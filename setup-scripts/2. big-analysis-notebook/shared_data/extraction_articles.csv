We randomized 202 patients with treatment-naïve mCRPC to abiraterone or enzalutamide and performed whole-exome and deep targeted 72-gene sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA prior to therapy. For these agents, which have never been directly compared, time to progression was similar. Defects in<i>BRCA2</i>and<i>ATM</i>were strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of clinical prognostic factors and circulating tumor DNA abundance. Somatic alterations in<i>TP53</i>, previously linked to reduced tumor dependency on AR signaling, were also independently associated with rapid resistance. Although detection of<i>AR</i>amplifications did not outperform standard prognostic biomarkers,<i>AR</i>gene structural rearrangements truncating the ligand binding domain were identified in several patients with primary resistance. These findings establish genomic drivers of resistance to first-line AR-directed therapy in mCRPC and identify potential minimally invasive biomarkers.<b>Significance:</b>Leveraging plasma specimens collected in a large randomized phase II trial, we report the relative impact of common circulating tumor DNA alterations on patient response to the most widely used therapies for advanced prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that liquid biopsy analysis can guide the use of AR-targeted therapy in general practice.<i>Cancer Discov; 8(4); 444-57. ©2018 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Jayaram et al., p. 392</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 371</i>.",0.132

Based on preclinical models, we conducted a phase I trial of two schedules of lapatinib and vinorelbine.

PATIENT AND METHODS: Patients had advanced solid tumors and up to two prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were enrolled on two dose-escalating schedules of lapatinib, continuous (arm A) or intermittent (arm B), with vinorelbine on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Tumors from a subset of patients were evaluated for gene mutations and expression of targets of interest.

RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were treated. The most common grade 3/4 toxic effects included leukopenia, neutropenia, and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxic effects were grade 3 infection, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea (arm A) and bone pain and fatigue (arm B). The maximum tolerated dose was vinorelbine 20 mg/m(2) weekly and lapatinib 1500 mg daily (arm A) and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) weekly and lapatinib 1500 mg intermittently (arm B). One patient on each arm had a complete response; both had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. In a subset of patients, lack of tumor PTEN expression correlated with a shorter time to progression.

CONCLUSION: In an unselected population, two schedules of lapatinib and vinorelbine were feasible and well tolerated.",0.600

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 2-stage genome-wide association study was performed. Patients were split randomly into a stage I discovery cohort (132 cases, 103 controls) and a stage II replication cohort (128 cases, 102 controls). The discovery cohort was genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0 genome-wide arrays. The 940 top ranking SNPs selected from the discovery cohort were genotyped in the replication cohort using Illumina iSelect custom SNP arrays.

RESULTS: Twelve SNPs identified in the discovery cohort and validated in the replication cohort were associated with development of ED following radiation therapy (Fisher combined P values 2.1×10(-5) to 6.2×10(-4)). Notably, these 12 SNPs lie in or near genes involved in erectile function or other normal cellular functions (adhesion and signaling) rather than DNA damage repair. In a multivariable model including nongenetic risk factors, the odds ratios for these SNPs ranged from 1.6 to 5.6 in the pooled cohort. There was a striking relationship between the cumulative number of SNP risk alleles an individual possessed and ED status (Sommers' D P value=1.7×10(-29)). A 1-allele increase in cumulative SNP score increased the odds for developing ED by a factor of 2.2 (P value=2.1×10(-19)). The cumulative SNP score model had a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 75% for prediction of developing ED at the radiation therapy planning stage.

CONCLUSIONS: This genome-wide association study identified a set of SNPs that are associated with development of ED following radiation therapy. These candidate genetic predictors warrant more definitive validation in an independent cohort.",0.230
11100895,https://sysrev.com/p/70431/article/11100895,TMPRSS2-ERG status in circulating tumor cells as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate.,European urology,"Danila, DC.; Anand, A.; Sung, CC.; Heller, G.; Leversha, MA.; Cao, L.; Lilja, H.; Molina, A.; Sawyers, CL.; Fleisher, M.; Scher, HI.","BACKGROUND: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor shown to prolong life in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) already treated with chemotherapy. AA treatment results in dramatic declines in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in some patients and no declines in others, suggesting the presence of molecular determinants of sensitivity in tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To study the role of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion, an androgen-dependent growth factor, in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a biomarker of sensitivity to AA.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG status was studied in 41 of 48 men with postchemotherapy-treated CRPC enrolled in sequential phase 2 AA trials.

INTERVENTION: Patients received AA 1000 mg daily and continuously.

MEASUREMENTS: TMPRSS2-ERG status was characterized by a sensitive, analytically valid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay in CTCs enriched from ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulated blood obtained prior to AA treatment. Outcomes were measured by PSA Working Group 1 criteria.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Standard procedures for specimen acquisition, processing, and testing using the validated TMPRSS2-ERG assay on a multiplex platform gave intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation <7%. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was present in 15 of 41 patients (37%), who had a median baseline CTC count of 17 (interquartile range: 7-103 cells per 7.5 ml). A PSA decline ≥50% was observed in 7 of 15 patients (47%) with the fusion and in 10 of 26 patients (38%) without the fusion. Although limited by the low number of patients, a posttherapy CTC count of less than five per 7.5 ml was prognostic for longer survival relative to a CTC count five or more. TMPRSS2-ERG status did not predict a decline in PSA or other clinical outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS: Molecular profiles of CTCs with an analytically valid assay identified the presence of the prostate cancer-specific TMPRSS2-ERG fusion but did not predict for response to AA treatment. This finding demonstrates the role of CTCs as surrogate tissue that can be obtained in a routine practice setting.

Oncology,"Barnett, GC.; Coles, CE.; Elliott, RM.; Baynes, C.; Luccarini, C.; Conroy, D.; Wilkinson, JS.; Tyrer, J.; Misra, V.; Platte, R.; Gulliford, SL.; Sydes, MR.; Hall, E.; Bentzen, SM.; Dearnaley, DP.; Burnet, NG.; Pharoah, PD.; Dunning, AM.; West, CM.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported associations between radiation toxicity and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes. Few associations have been tested in independent validation studies. This prospective study aimed to validate reported associations between genotype and radiation toxicity in a large independent dataset.

METHODS: 92 (of 98 attempted) SNPs in 46 genes were successfully genotyped in 1613 patients: 976 received adjuvant breast radiotherapy in the Cambridge breast IMRT trial (ISRCTN21474421, n=942) or in a prospective study of breast toxicity at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK (n=34). A further 637 received radical prostate radiotherapy in the MRC RT01 multicentre trial (ISRCTN47772397, n=224) or in the Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (CHHiP) trial (ISRCTN97182923, n=413). Late toxicity was assessed 2 years after radiotherapy with a validated photographic technique (patients with breast cancer only), clinical assessment, and patient questionnaires. Association tests of genotype with overall radiation toxicity score and individual endpoints were undertaken in univariate and multivariable analyses. At a type I error rate adjusted for multiple testing, this study had 99% power to detect a SNP, with minor allele frequency of 0·35, associated with a per allele odds ratio of 2·2.

FINDINGS: None of the previously reported associations were confirmed by this study, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The p value distribution of the SNPs tested against overall toxicity score was not different from that expected by chance.

INTERPRETATION: We did not replicate previously reported late toxicity associations, suggesting that we can essentially exclude the hypothesis that published SNPs individually exert a clinically relevant effect. Continued recruitment of patients into studies within the Radiogenomics Consortium is essential so that sufficiently powered studies can be done and methodological challenges addressed.

Little is known about allelic loss or gain pertaining to genes associated with the androgen synthesis axis and whether this is prognostic in patients who receive localized radiotherapy. In this hypothesis generating study, we conducted an array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis of 33 androgen synthesis genes to identify potential prognostic factors for radiotherapy outcome.

METHODS: aCGH analysis of tumor DNA prospectively derived from frozen needle biopsies of 126 men with intermediate-risk disease who underwent image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) to a mean dose of 76.4 Gy was conducted. Statistical analyses were conducted for allelic loss or gain in genes as potential prognostic factors relative to prostate specific antigen, Gleason-score, and T-category.

RESULTS: We observed that allelic losses of loci containing the genes StAR and HSD17B2 were associated with increased genetic instability (as determined by percentage genome alteration). On multivariate analyses these loci were prognostic for biochemical disease-free relapse (StAR: HR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.44-5.61, P = 0.00269; HSD17B2: HR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06-3.64, P = 0.031). The results were validated in a surgical cohort of 131 intermediate-risk patients.

CONCLUSIONS: Allelic losses of the loci containing StAR and HSD17B2 have significant prognostic value for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. With this hypothesis generating information future studies should test StAR and HSD17B2 losses as biomarkers of androgen response in combined modality protocols.",0.312

Thalidomide is an active anticancer agent and also shows wide pharmacological variation. Past pharmacogenetic research has not explained this variation. Patients with prostate cancer enrolled in a randomized phase II trial using docetaxel and thalidomide versus docetaxel alone were genotyped using the Affymetrix DMET 1.0 platform, which tests for 1256 genetic variations in 170 drug disposition genes. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed for associations with clinical response and toxicity. In all, 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes were potentially associated with response to therapy: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta), sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1C, member 2 (SULT1C2) and carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3). In addition, 11 SNPs in eight genes were associated with toxicities to treatment: spastic paraplegia 7 (pure and complicated autosomal recessive) (SPG7), CHST3, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6), N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (NAT2), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 6 (ABCC6), ATPase, Cu++ transporting, alpha polypeptide (ATP7A), cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP4B1) and solute carrier family 10 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family), member 2 (SLC10A2). Genotyping results between drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) and direct sequencing showed >96% of concordance.

This study explored a hypothesis that patients with poor metabolizing phenotype of CYP2C19 receive little benefit from thalidomide treatment and that the poor metabolizer genotype is associated with lower ability to form the metabolites. A case-control study was conducted with 63 patients with prostate cancer who had been enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of thalidomide monotherapy (200 to 1,200 mg/day). CYP2C19 polymorphism (CYP2C19(*)2, CYP2C19(*)3, CYP2C19(*)4) was compared with clinical events (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline) and formations of the hydroxylated metabolites. Two patients were homozygous for the variant CYP2C19(*)2 allele (poor metabolizing phenotype). Both of these were included in the 25 patients whose PSA failed to demonstrate a decline. While 32% and 48% of the patients had quantifiable levels of 5-hydroxythalidomide and cis-5'-hydroxythalidomide, respectively, these metabolite were below quantification in both poor metabolizing patients. None had CYP2C19(*)3 or CYP2C19(*)4 alleles. Although this study had no power to detect the statistical significance of the CYP2C19 genotype, the findings were consistent with our hypothesis. The role of CYP2C19 polymorphism in thalidomide treatments remains to be elucidated.",0.196

We conducted a clinical evaluation in humans of olaparib (AZD2281), a novel, potent, orally active PARP inhibitor.

METHODS: This was a phase 1 trial that included the analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of olaparib. Selection was aimed at having a study population enriched in carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

RESULTS: We enrolled and treated 60 patients; 22 were carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 1 had a strong family history of BRCA-associated cancer but declined to undergo mutational testing. The olaparib dose and schedule were increased from 10 mg daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 mg twice daily continuously. Reversible dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one of eight patients receiving 400 mg twice daily (grade 3 mood alteration and fatigue) and two of five patients receiving 600 mg twice daily (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 somnolence). This led us to enroll another cohort, consisting only of carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, to receive olaparib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the mutation carriers. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination; pharmacodynamic studies confirmed PARP inhibition in surrogate samples (of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and plucked eyebrow-hair follicles) and tumor tissue. Objective antitumor activity was reported only in mutation carriers, all of whom had ovarian, breast, or prostate cancer and had received multiple treatment regimens.

CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib has few of the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapy, inhibits PARP, and has antitumor activity in cancer associated with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00516373.)",0.217

As genetic heterogeneity in drug targets can influence drug response, we sought to further evaluate the contribution of CYP2D6 to pharmacodynamic sensitivity in our previous study sample in tandem with DRD2, the primary molecular target for perphenazine.

METHODS: Genotyping for DRD2 Taq1A, -141C ins/del and Ser311Cys functional polymorphisms was performed using PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism methods.

RESULTS: After controlling for DRD2 polymorphisms, CYP2D6 was a significant predictor of pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity to perphenazine (P=0.024; power=80.4%). Taq1A polymorphism significantly influenced the time course of prolactin response (P=0.039; power=70%). A1/A1 genotype displayed a higher prolactin elevation 2 h after perphenazine administration (P=0.02). Patients with -141C ins/ins genotype showed a strong trend toward a 38% larger prolactin AUC compared with the -141C ins/del genotypic group (P=0.07).

CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 seems to be an independent contributor to pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity to perphenazine after accounting for DRD2 functional polymorphisms. The A1 allele of the Taq1A polymorphism was previously shown to decrease D2 receptor density in vitro and in neuroimaging studies in vivo. At a given antipsychotic dose, individuals with A1 allele might thus achieve a higher DRD2 antipsychotic occupancy, which is consistent with an increased prolactin elevation in the A1/A1 genotype in this study. These findings provide a basis for further studies on the endogenous substrates of CYP2D6 and the rational selection of candidate genes for long-term consequences of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia (e.g. susceptibility to breast and prostate cancers).",0.273

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this single arm study. The primary objective was to determine if the presence of ERCC1 Asn118Asn (N118N, 500C>T, rs11615) and XRCC1 Arg399Gln (R399Q, 1301G>A, rs25487) genetic variants might be associated with an impact on progression-free survival (PFS); secondary objectives included overall response, survival, and toxicity.

RESULTS: After population stratification by race, white patients carrying heterozygous or variant genotypes at the ERCC1 C>T locus had a >3-fold longer median PFS (5.8 vs. 1.8 months; 2P = .18, adjusted) and 5-fold longer median overall survival (OS) (15.7 vs. 3.2 months; 2P = .010, adjusted) than did patients carrying only wild-type alleles. For the XRCC1 G>A variant, without regard to race, patients carrying the wild-type GG alleles had a longer PFS (9.3 months) than those carrying GA or AA alleles (2.7 months; 2P = .02). Similarly, those carrying GG alleles did not reach median OS, whereas those carrying GA or AA alleles had a median OS of 9.6 months (2P = .12, adjusted). Multivariable analysis by using Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated that only XRCC1 was associated with PFS.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to date in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that describes predictive germline polymorphisms of ERCC1 and XRCC1 for assessing the clinical activity of satraplatin.",0.798

Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function. We investigated the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and preliminary antitumour activity of niraparib.

METHODS: In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled patients with advanced solid tumours at one site in the UK and two sites in the USA. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less; had assessable disease; were not suitable to receive any established treatments; had adequate organ function; and had discontinued any previous anticancer treatments at least 4 weeks previously. In part A, cohorts of three to six patients, enriched for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, received niraparib daily at ten escalating doses from 30 mg to 400 mg in a 21-day cycle to establish the maximum tolerated dose. Dose expansion at the maximum tolerated dose was pursued in 15 patients to confirm tolerability. In part B, we further investigated the maximum tolerated dose in patients with sporadic platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer and sporadic prostate cancer. We obtained blood, circulating tumour cells, and optional paired tumour biopsies for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Toxic effects were assessed by common toxicity criteria and tumour responses ascribed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Circulating tumour cells and archival tumour tissue in prostate patients were analysed for exploratory putative predictive biomarkers, such as loss of PTEN expression and ETS rearrangements. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00749502.

FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2008, and Jan 14, 2011, we enrolled 100 patients: 60 in part A and 40 in part B. 300 mg/day was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxic effects reported in the first cycle were grade 3 fatigue (one patient given 30 mg/day), grade 3 pneumonitis (one given 60 mg/day), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (two given 400 mg/day). Common treatment-related toxic effects were anaemia (48 patients [48%]), nausea (42 [42%]), fatigue (42 [42%]), thrombocytopenia (35 [35%]), anorexia (26 [26%]), neutropenia (24 [24%]), constipation (23 [23%]), and vomiting (20 [20%]), and were predominantly grade 1 or 2. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 36·4 h (range 32·8-46·0). Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed PARP inhibition exceeded 50% at doses greater than 80 mg/day and antitumour activity was documented beyond doses of 60 mg/day. Eight (40% [95% CI 19-64]) of 20 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with ovarian cancer had RECIST partial responses, as did two (50% [7-93]) of four mutation carriers with breast cancer. Antitumour activity was also reported in sporadic high-grade serous ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. We recorded no correlation between loss of PTEN expression or ETS rearrangements and measures of antitumour activity in patients with prostate cancer.

INTERPRETATION: A recommended phase 2 dose of 300 mg/day niraparib is well tolerated. Niraparib should be further assessed in inherited and sporadic cancers with homologous recombination DNA repair defects and to target PARP-mediated transcription in cancer.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies.

RESULTS: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

To understand how variation in CYP3A4 correlated with outcomes, a retrospective examination of the CYP3A4 *1B genotype was performed on men treated with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 92-02.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1,514 cases, we evaluated 56 (28.4%) of 197 AA and 54 (4.3%) of 1,274 European American (EA) patients. All patients received goserelin and flutamide for 2 months before and during RT (STAD-RT) +/- 24 months of goserelin (long-term androgen deprivation plus radiation [LTAD-RT]). Events studied included overall survival and biochemical progression using American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus guidelines.

RESULTS: There were no differences in outcome in patients in with or without CYP3A4 data. There was an association between race and CYP3A4 polymorphisms with 75% of EAs having the Wild Type compared to only 25% of AA men (p <0.0001). There was no association between CYP3A4 classification or race and survival or progression.

CONCLUSIONS: The samples analyzed support previously reported observations about the distribution of CYP3A4 *1B genotype by race, but race was not associated with poorer outcome. However, patient numbers were limited, and selection bias cannot be completely ruled out.",0.442

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tumor tissue was sufficient for p53 analysis in 777 cases. p53 status was determined by immunohistochemistry. Abnormal p53 expression was defined as 20% or more tumor cells with positive nuclei. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationships of p53 status to patient outcomes.

RESULTS: Abnormal p53 was detected in 168 of 777 (21.6%) cases, and was significantly associated with cause-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 - 3.14; p = 0.014) and distant metastasis (adjusted HR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.13-2.62; p = 0.013). When patients were divided into subgroups according to assigned treatment, only the subgroup of patients who underwent STAD + RT showed significant correlation between p53 status and cause-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.32-4.49; p = 0.0044). When patients were divided into subgroups according to p53 status, only the subgroup of patients with abnormal p53 showed significant association between assigned treatment and cause-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 3.81; 95% CI 1.40-10.37; p = 0.0087).

CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal p53 is a significant prognostic factor for patients with prostate cancer who undergo short-term androgen deprivation and radiotherapy. Long-term androgen deprivation may significantly improve the cause-specific survival for those with abnormal p53.",0.315

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and to explore potentially predictive serum biomarkers by proteomics, the significance of PTEN status in tumor tissue, and the impact of everolimus on immune cell subpopulations and function.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 37 chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC and progressive disease were recruited to this single-arm phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00976755).

INTERVENTION: Everolimus was administered continuously at a dose of 10mg daily.

OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 wk defined as the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic progression, or clinical progression. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Fisher exact tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. Time-to-event end points were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 13 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval, 20-53) met the primary end point. Confirmed PSA response ≥50% was seen in two (5%), and four further patients (11%) had a PSA decline ≥30%. Higher serum levels of carboxypeptidase M and apolipoprotein B were predictive for reaching the primary end point. Deletion of PTEN was associated with longer PFS and response. Treatment was associated with a dose-dependent decrease of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes and CD8 proliferation and an increase in regulatory T cells. Small sample size was the major limitation of the study.

CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus activity in unselected patients with mCRPC is moderate, but PTEN deletion could be predictive for response. Several serum glycoproteins were able to predict PFS at 12 wk. Prospective validation of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

Prior studies have suggested that HPC1 or R462Q associated tumors present with more aggressive clinical features. We assessed a series of men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinical and pathological measures of tumor aggressiveness according to the RNASEL R462Q genotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of 232 men treated for prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy was performed. Disease aggressiveness at diagnosis was assessed by age at disease onset, biopsy Gleason score, clinical T stage and pretreatment prostate specific antigen. Tumor aggressiveness was assessed pathologically by tumor volume, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node metastasis. Clinical and pathological characteristics were then correlated with RNASEL genotype.

RESULTS: Of the 232 men studied 104 (45%) were homozygous WT, 101 (43%) were heterozygous and 27 (12%) were homozygous for the R462Q variant, mirroring the distribution in the general population. No significant differences were seen between genotypes in age at disease onset, pretreatment characteristics or pathological features, as assessed by surgical grade and pathological stage. Tumors homozygous for the R462Q variant were of smaller volume than other genotypes (p = 0.02).

CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study suggests that prostate cancer in patients with the R462Q allelic variant of the HPC1/RNASEL gene is not associated with more aggressive clinical or pathological features in radical prostatectomy specimens.",0.285

In this phase II trial, we evaluate neoadjuvant enzalutamide and leuprolide (EL) with or without abiraterone and prednisone (ELAP) before radical prostatectomy (RP) in men with locally advanced prostate cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had a biopsy Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 or greater, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater than 20 ng/mL, or T3 disease (by prostate magnetic resonance imaging). Lymph nodes were required to be smaller than 20 mm. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to ELAP or EL for 24 weeks followed by RP. All specimens underwent central pathology review. The primary end point was pathologic complete response or minimal residual disease (residual tumor ≤ 5 mm). Secondary end points were PSA, surgical staging, positive margins, and safety. Biomarkers associated with pathologic outcomes were explored.

RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled at four centers. Most patients had high-risk disease by National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria (n = 65; 87%). The pathologic complete response or minimal residual disease rate was 30% (n = 15 of 50) in ELAP-treated patients and 16% (n = four of 25) in EL-treated patients (two-sided P = .263). Rates of ypT3 disease, positive margins, and positive lymph nodes were similar between arms. Treatment was well-tolerated. Residual tumors in the two arms showed comparable levels of ERG, PTEN, androgen receptor PSA, and glucocorticoid receptor expression. Tumor ERG positivity and PTEN loss were associated with more extensive residual tumors at RP.

CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant hormone therapy followed by RP in locally advanced prostate cancer resulted in favorable pathologic responses in some patients, with a trend toward improved pathologic outcomes with ELAP. Longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate the impact of therapy on recurrence rates. The potential association of ERG and PTEN alterations with worse outcomes warrants additional investigation.",0.389

Here, we report on the testing of a previously identified candidate androgen signalling signature associated with response to androgen signalling inhibition.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on the outcome of the first module of a phase II trial on abiraterone acetate (AA) followed by combination with dasatinib or sunitinib. Bone marrow biopsies (BMBs) with matched bone marrow aspirate and blood samples were collected at baseline and upon progression. End-points included assessment of a prespecified molecular signature consisting of nuclear androgen receptor (AR) overexpression, cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP17) expression, and AR-C-/N terminal expression ratio of ≥0.8 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients with benefit versus primary resistance to AA (i.e. progression within 4 months). Tumour markers also included v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (ERG), androgen receptor splice variant (ARV7) by IHC and steroids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

RESULTS: Of 170 patients accrued from 03/2011 to 02/2015, 44 (26%) were primary resistant to AA. Forty-eight patients had tumour infiltrated BMB at baseline. Pretreatment androgen signalling signature was linked to benefit from AA (p < 0.001). Presence of ERG was associated with benefit (p = 0.05), whereas nuclear ARV7 presence and 20 or more bone lesions at baseline with primary resistance (p = 0.04 and p = 0.0006, respectively).

CONCLUSION: Testing of a prespecified androgen signalling signature was highly supportive of its predictive value in maximal androgen deprivation strategies in mCRPC. Further validation is under way.

Detection of serum free methylated GSTP1 (mGSTP1) DNA is associated with overall survival (OS) and response to docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in test and internal validation cohorts.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between serum free mGSTP1 and treatment outcomes in SYNERGY, a phase 3 multicentre randomised trial testing the addition of custirsen to first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel in mCRPC.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Serum free mGSTP1 DNA was measured by a sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay in paired samples (baseline and after two cycles of docetaxel) from 600 patients.

OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Associations between serum free mGSTP1 at baseline, change in mGSTP1 after docetaxel, OS, and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier methods.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Serum free mGSTP1 was detectable at baseline in 458 (81%) patients. Of those with detectable mGSTP1 at baseline, mGSTP1 became undetectable after two cycles in 243 (53%). Undetectable mGSTP1 at baseline was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.55; p<0.00001). The event of mGSTP1 becoming undetectable after two cycles of chemotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29-0.46; p<0.00001) and longer time to PSA progression (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.35-0.56; p<0.00001). Associations between mGSTP1 and clinical outcomes were independent of other established prognostic variables. Analysis was limited by the lack of radiographic progression-free survival data.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to externally validate the prognostic role of a circulating epigenetic biomarker in mCRPC. Further studies are needed to validate serum free mGSTP1 as a surrogate endpoint for clinical trials and as a potential clinical decision tool.

The safety and efficacy of durvalumab and gefitinib in combination for TKI-naive patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC was evaluated.

METHODS: This Phase 1 open-label, multicentre trial (NCT02088112) was conducted in 56 patients with NSCLC. Dose expansion permitted TKI-naive patients, primarily with activating L858R or Ex19del EGFRm. Arms 1 + 1a received concurrent therapy; Arm 2 received 4 weeks of gefitinib induction followed by concurrent therapy.

RESULTS: From dose escalation, the recommended dose of durvalumab was 10 mg/kg Q2W with 250 mg QD gefitinib. Pharmacokinetics were as expected, consistent with inhibition of soluble PD-L1 and no treatment-emergent immunogenicity. In dose expansion, 35% of patients had elevated liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation. In Arms 1 + 1a, objective response rate was 63.3% (95% CI: 43.9-80.1), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months (95% CI: 5.5-15.2) and median response duration was 9.2 months (95% CI: 3.7-14.0).

CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab and gefitinib in combination had higher toxicity than either agent alone. No significant increase in PFS was detected compared with historical controls.

Here, we investigated whether these same SNPs are associated with risk of lower- and higher-grade prostate cancer in men randomized to finasteride, and with prevalence of intraprostatic inflammation among controls. Methods A total of 16 candidate SNPs in IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12(p40), IFNG, MSR1, RNASEL, TLR4, and TNFA and 7 tagSNPs in IL10 were genotyped in 625 white prostate cancer cases, and 532 white controls negative for cancer on an end-of-study biopsy nested in the PCPT finasteride arm. We used logistic regression to estimate log-additive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for age and family history.

RESULTS: Minor alleles of rs2243250 (T) in IL4 (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.08, P-trend = 0.03), rs1800896 (G) in IL10 (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.96, P-trend = 0.02), rs2430561 (A) in IFNG (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.74; P-trend = 0.04), rs3747531 (C) in MSR1 (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95; P-trend = 0.03), and possibly rs4073 (A) in IL8 (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.01, P-trend = 0.06) were associated with higher- (Gleason 7-10; N = 222), but not lower- (Gleason 2-6; N = 380) grade prostate cancer. In men with low PSA (<2 ng/mL), these higher-grade disease associations were attenuated and/or no longer significant, whereas associations with higher-grade disease were apparent for minor alleles of rs1800795 (C: OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.94, P-trend = 0.02) and rs1800797 (A: OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98, P-trend = 0.04) in IL6. While some IL10 tagSNPs were associated with lower- and higher-grade prostate cancer, distributions of IL10 haplotypes did not differ, except possibly between higher-grade cases and controls among those with low PSA (P = 0.07). We did not observe an association between the studied SNPs and intraprostatic inflammation in the controls.

CONCLUSION: In the PCPT finasteride arm, variation in genes involved in the immune response, including possibly IL8 and IL10 as in the placebo arm, may be associated with prostate cancer, especially higher-grade disease, but not with intraprostatic inflammation. We cannot rule out PSA-associated detection bias or chance due to multiple testing.",0.255

Compared with circulating estrogen, the intraprostatic estrogen milieu may play a more important role in prostate carcinogenesis. Using a nested case-control design in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), we examined associations of genetic variants of genes that are involved in estrogen synthesis, metabolism and function with prostate cancer risk. A total of 25 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 genes (PGR, ESR1, ESR2, CYP17A1, HSD17B1, CYP19A1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, COMT, UGT1A6, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, UGT2B15) were examined in whites only. Controls (n = 1380) were frequency matched to cases on age, PCPT treatment arm, and family history (n = 1506). Logistic regression models adjusted for age and family history were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) separately in the placebo and finasteride arms. SNPs associated with prostate cancer risk differed by treatment arm. The associations appeared to be modified by circulating estrogen and androgen levels. CYP19A1 was the only gene harboring SNPs that were significantly associated with risk in both the placebo and finasteride arms. Haplotype analysis with all three CYP19A1 SNPs genotyped (rs700518, rs2445765, rs700519) showed that risk-allele haplotypes are associated with the increased prostate cancer risk in both arms when comparing with the non-risk allele haplotype.

We sought to characterize the clinical and genomic features of t-SCNC in a multi-institutional prospective study. Methods Patients with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) underwent metastatic tumor biopsy and were followed for survival. Metastatic biopsy specimens underwent independent, blinded pathology review along with RNA/DNA sequencing. Results A total of 202 consecutive patients were enrolled. One hundred forty-eight (73%) had prior disease progression on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The biopsy evaluable rate was 79%. The overall incidence of t-SCNC detection was 17%. AR amplification and protein expression were present in 67% and 75%, respectively, of t-SCNC biopsy specimens. t-SCNC was detected at similar proportions in bone, node, and visceral organ biopsy specimens. Genomic alterations in the DNA repair pathway were nearly mutually exclusive with t-SCNC differentiation ( P = .035).

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the transcriptome identified a small-cell-like cluster that further enriched for adverse survival outcomes (hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.25 to 7.19). A t-SCNC transcriptional signature was developed and validated in multiple external data sets with > 90% accuracy. Multiple transcriptional regulators of t-SCNC were identified, including the pancreatic neuroendocrine marker PDX1. Conclusion t-SCNC is present in nearly one fifth of patients with mCRPC and is associated with shortened survival. The near-mutual exclusivity with DNA repair alterations suggests t-SCNC may be a distinct subset of mCRPC. Transcriptional profiling facilitates the identification of t-SCNC and novel therapeutic targets.",0.239

Patients and Methods Patients with solid tumors were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis after a single dose (Cycle 0) informed dose escalation using accelerated dose titration. Once one grade 2 toxicity or dose-limiting toxicity was observed in Cycle 1, the accelerated dose titration was terminated and a 3 + 3 dose escalation was started. Continuous daily dosing was evaluated along with two intermittent regimens (7 days on/7 days off and 3 times per week). In the expansion phase at RP2D, patients with endometrial or prostate cancer, as well as those with select tumor types with a PIK3CA mutation, AKT mutation or PTEN loss, were enrolled. Patients were evaluated for adverse events (AEs), PK parameters, blood glucose and insulin levels, and tumor response. Results The RP2D of GSK2141795 for once-daily dosing is 75 mg. The most common (>10%) treatment-related AEs included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Most AEs were low grade. The frequency of hyperglycemia increased with dose; however, at the RP2D, grade 3 hyperglycemia was only reported in 4% of patients and no grade 4 events were observed. PK characteristics were favorable, with a prolonged half-life and low peak-to-trough ratio. There were two partial responses at the RP2D in patients with either a PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss. Conclusion GSK2141795 was safe and well-tolerated, with clinical activity seen as monotherapy at the RP2D of 75 mg daily. NCT00920257.",0.206

Patients and Methods Patients underwent metastatic site biopsy and were stratified by ETS status and randomly assigned to abiraterone plus prednisone without (arm A) or with veliparib (arm B). Primary objectives were: confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) and whether ETS fusions predicted response. Secondary objectives were: safety, measurable disease RR (mRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and molecular biomarker analysis. A total of 148 patients were randomly assigned to detect a 20% PSA RR improvement. Results A total of 148 patients with mCRPC were randomly assigned: arm A, n = 72; arm B, n = 76. There were no differences in PSA RR (63.9% v 72.4%; P = .27), mRR (45.0% v 52.2%; P = .51), or median PFS (10.1 v 11 months; P = .99). ETS fusions did not predict response. Exploratory analysis of tumor sequencing (80 patients) revealed: 41 patients (51%) were ETS positive, 20 (25%) had DNA-damage repair defect (DRD), 41 (51%) had AR amplification or copy gain, 34 (43%) had PTEN mutation, 33 (41%) had TP53 mutation, 39 (49%) had PIK3CA pathway activation, and 12 (15%) had WNT pathway alteration. Patients with DRD had significantly higher PSA RR (90% v 56.7%; P = .007) and mRR (87.5% v 38.6%; P = .001), PSA decline ≥ 90% (75% v 25%; P = .001), and longer median PFS (14.5 v 8.1 months; P = .025) versus those with wild-type tumors.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in<i>BRCA1</i>,<i>BRCA2</i>, or<i>ATM</i>; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review.

RESULTS: In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib.

CONCLUSIONS: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

Long-term use of prednisone has been suggested as one of the mechanisms driving resistance, which may be reversed by switching to another steroid.

METHODS: SWITCH was a single-arm, open-label, single-stage phase II study. The primary objective was to evaluate the antitumour activity of abiraterone acetate plus dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily (AA + D) in mCRPC patients progressing to AA + P. Clinically stable mCRPC patients who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or limited radiographic progression after at least 12 weeks on AA + P, were eligible. The primary endpoint was measured as the proportion of patients achieving a PSA decline of  ≥ 30% (PSA30) from baseline after 6 weeks on AA + D. Secondary endpoints included: PSA50 response rate at 12 weeks, time to biochemical and radiological progression, overall survival, safety profile evaluation, benefit from subsequent treatment lines and the identification of biomarkers of response (AR copy number, TMPRSS2-ERG status and PTEN expression).

RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled. PSA30 and PSA50 were 46.2% and 34.6%, respectively. Median time to biochemical and radiological progression were 5.3 and 11.8 months, respectively. Two radiological responses were observed. Median overall survival was 20.9 months. Patients with AR gain detected in plasma circulating tumour DNA did not respond to switch, whereas patients with AR normal status benefited the most. No significant toxicities were observed and PSA50 response rate to subsequent taxane was 50%.

CONCLUSIONS: In selected clinical stable mCRPC patients with limited disease progression on AA + P, a steroid switch from prednisone to dexamethasone can lead to PSA and radiological responses.",0.508

Patients and methods: In a prospective clinical trial, mCRPC patients underwent whole-exome sequencing (n = 82) and RNA sequencing (n = 75) of metastatic biopsies before initiating AA/P with the objective of identifying genomic alterations associated with resistance to AA/P. Primary resistance was determined at 12 weeks of treatment using criteria for progression that included serum prostate-specific antigen measurement, bone and computerized tomography imaging and symptom assessments. Acquired resistance was determined using the end point of time to treatment change (TTTC), defined as time from enrollment until change in treatment from progressive disease. Associations of genomic and transcriptomic alterations with primary resistance were determined using logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, single and multivariate analyses. Cox regression models were utilized for determining association of genomic and transcriptomic alterations with TTTC.

Results: At 12 weeks, 32 patients in the cohort had progressed (nonresponders). Median study follow-up was 32.1 months by which time 58 patients had switched treatments due to progression. Median TTTC was 10.1 months (interquartile range: 4.4-24.1). Genes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were more frequently mutated and negative regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling were more frequently deleted or displayed reduced mRNA expression in nonresponders. Additionally, mRNA expression of cell cycle regulatory genes was increased in nonresponders. In multivariate models, increased cell cycle proliferation scores (≥ 50) were associated with shorter TTTC (hazard ratio = 2.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-3.80; P = 0.01).

Conclusions: Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and increased cell cycle progression scores can serve as molecular markers for predicting resistance to AA/P therapy.",0.326

Germline genetic data from 1,157 prostate cancer cases in PCPT were analyzed by case-only methods. Genotypes included 357 SNPs from 83 candidate genes in androgen metabolism, inflammation, circadian rhythm, and other pathways. Univariate case-only analysis was conducted to evaluate whether individual SNPs modified the finasteride effect on the risk of high-grade and low-grade prostate cancer. Case-only classification trees and random forests, which are powerful machine learning methods with resampling-based controls for model complexity, were employed to identify a predictive signature for genotype-specific treatment effects. Accounting for multiple testing, a single SNP in<i>SRD5A1</i>gene (rs472402) significantly modified the finasteride effect on high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score > 6) in PCPT (family-wise error rate < 0.05). Men carrying GG genotype at this locus had a 55% reduction of the risk in developing high-grade cancer when assigned to finasteride (RR = 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.75). Additional effect-modifying SNPs with moderate statistical significance were identified by case-only trees and random forests. A prediction model built by the case-only random forest method with 28 selected SNPs classified 37% of PCPT men to have reduced risk of high-grade prostate cancer when taking finasteride, while the others have increased risk. In conclusion, case-only methods identified SNPs that modified the effect of finasteride on the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and predicted a subgroup of men who had reduced cancer risk by finasteride.",0.250

The TOPARP-B trial aims to prospectively validate the association between DDR gene aberrations and response to olaparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

METHODS: In this open-label, investigator-initiated, randomised phase 2 trial following a selection (or pick-the-winner) design, we recruited participants from 17 UK hospitals. Men aged 18 years or older with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with one or two taxane chemotherapy regimens and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less had tumour biopsies tested with targeted sequencing. Patients with DDR gene aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated minimisation method, with balancing for circulating tumour cell count at screening, to receive 400 mg or 300 mg olaparib twice daily, given continuously in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to dose allocation. The primary endpoint of confirmed response was defined as a composite of all patients presenting with any of the following outcomes: radiological objective response (as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1), a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 50% or more (PSA50) from baseline, or conversion of circulating tumour cell count (from ≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline to <5 cells per 7·5 mL blood). A confirmed response in a consecutive assessment after at least 4 weeks was required for each component. The primary analysis was done in the evaluable population. If at least 19 (43%) of 44 evaluable patients in a dose cohort responded, then the dose cohort would be considered successful. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01682772. Recruitment for the trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing.

FINDINGS: 711 patients consented for targeted screening between April 1, 2015, and Aug 30, 2018. 161 patients had DDR gene aberrations, 98 of whom were randomly assigned and treated (49 patients for each olaparib dose), with 92 evaluable for the primary endpoint (46 patients for each olaparib dose). Median follow-up was 24·8 months (IQR 16·7-35·9). Confirmed composite response was achieved in 25 (54·3%; 95% CI 39·0-69·1) of 46 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort, and 18 (39·1%; 25·1-54·6) of 46 evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort. Radiological response was achieved in eight (24·2%; 11·1-42·3) of 33 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort and six (16·2%; 6·2-32·0) of 37 in the 300 mg cohort; PSA50 response was achieved in 17 (37·0%; 23·2-52·5) of 46 and 13 (30·2%; 17·2-46·1) of 43; and circulating tumour cell count conversion was achieved in 15 (53·6%; 33·9-72·5) of 28 and 13 (48·1%; 28·7-68·1) of 27. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event in both cohorts was anaemia (15 [31%] of 49 patients in the 300 mg cohort and 18 [37%] of 49 in the 400 mg cohort). 19 serious adverse reactions were reported in 13 patients. One death possibly related to treatment (myocardial infarction) occurred after 11 days of treatment in the 300 mg cohort.

INTERPRETATION: Olaparib has antitumour activity against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with DDR gene aberrations, supporting the implementation of genomic stratification of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in clinical practice.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a Local CRPC cohort, 42 prostatic specimens were collected from patients who were diagnosed as CRPC and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In a metastatic CRPC (Met CRPC) cohort, 12 metastatic biopsies were collected from CRPC patients who would be treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride (Clinical Trial NCT01393730). As controls, 36 benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients undergoing prostate reduction surgery for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The methylation status of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site(s) at SRD5A2 promoter regions was tested.

RESULTS: Compared with benign prostatic tissue, CRPC samples demonstrated higher SRD5A2 methylation in the whole promoter region (Local CRPC cohort: P < 0.001; Met CRPC cohort: P <0.05). In Local CRPC cohort, a higher ratio of methylation was correlated with better OS (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.013). Hypermethylation of specific regions (nucleotides -434 to -4 [CpG# -39 to CpG# -2]) was associated with a better OS (11.3±5.8 vs 6.4±4.4 years, P = 0.001) and PFS (8.4±5.4 vs 4.5±3.9 years, P = 0.003) with cutoff value of 37.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that SRD5A2 methylation was associated with OS independently (whole promoter region: P = 0.035; specific region: P = 0.02).

CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrate that SRD5A2 methylation in promoter regions, specifically at CpG# -39 to -2, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Recognition of epigenetic modifications of SRD5A2 may affect the choices and sequence of available therapies for management of CRPC.",0.080

Numerous germline SNPs influence prostate cancer susceptibility. The functional pathways in which these SNPs increase prostate cancer susceptibility are unknown. Finasteride is currently not being used routinely as a chemoprevention agent but the long term outcomes of the PCPT trial are awaited. The outcomes of the SELECT trial have not recommended the use of chemoprevention in preventing prostate cancer. This study investigated whether germline risk SNPs could be used to predict outcomes in the PCPT and SELECT trial.

METHODS: Genotyping was performed in European men entered into the PCPT trial (n = 2434) and SELECT (n = 4885). Next generation genotyping was performed using Affymetrix® Eureka™ Genotyping protocols. Logistic regression models were used to test the association of risk scores and the outcomes in the PCPT and SELECT trials.

RESULTS: Of the 100 SNPs, 98 designed successfully and genotyping was validated for samples genotyped on other platforms. A number of SNPs predicted for aggressive disease in both trials. Men with a higher polygenic score are more likely to develop prostate cancer in both trials, but the score did not predict for other outcomes in the trial.

CONCLUSION: Men with a higher polygenic risk score are more likely to develop prostate cancer. There were no interactions of these germline risk SNPs and the chemoprevention agents in the SELECT and PCPT trials.",0.264

However, not all patients respond, and resistance mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that genomic and transcriptional features from metastatic CRPC biopsies prior to treatment would be predictive of de novo treatment resistance. To this end, we conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide treatment (160 mg/d) in 36 men with metastatic CRPC. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for the primary end point of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)50 response (PSA decline ≥50% at 12 wk vs. baseline). Nine patients were classified as nonresponders (PSA decline <50%), and 25 patients were classified as responders (PSA decline ≥50%). Failure to achieve a PSA50 was associated with shorter progression-free survival, time on treatment, and overall survival, demonstrating PSA50's utility. Targeted DNA-sequencing was performed on 26 of 36 biopsies, and RNA-sequencing was performed on 25 of 36 biopsies that contained sufficient material. Using computational methods, we measured AR transcriptional function and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways whose activity state correlated with de novo resistance.<i>TP53</i>gene alterations were more common in nonresponders, although this did not reach statistical significance (<i>P</i>= 0.055).<i>AR</i>gene alterations and AR expression were similar between groups. Importantly, however, transcriptional measurements demonstrated that specific gene sets-including those linked to low AR transcriptional activity and a stemness program-were activated in nonresponders. Our results suggest that patients whose tumors harbor this program should be considered for clinical trials testing rational agents to overcome de novo enzalutamide resistance.",0.286

Durvalumab (D) is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) which inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to its receptor. Tremelimumab (T) is a mAb directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).

Retrospective studies have suggested an association between the adrenal-permissive allele, the frequency of which is highest in white men, and early development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Objective: To examine the association between the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) allele and early development of CRPC using prospective data.

Design, Setting, and Participants: The E3805 Chemohormonal Therapy vs Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) was a large, multicenter, phase 3 trial of castration with or without docetaxel treatment in men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. From July 28, 2006, through December 31, 2012, 790 patients underwent randomization, of whom 527 had available DNA samples. In this study, the HSD3B1 germline genotype was retrospectively determined in 475 white men treated in E3805 CHAARTED, and clinical outcomes were analyzed by genotype. Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2006, to October 17, 2018.

Interventions: Men were randomized to castration plus docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks for 6 cycles or castration alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Two-year freedom from CRPC and 5-year overall survival, with results stratified by disease volume. Patients were combined across study arms according to genotype to assess the overall outcome associated with genotype. Secondary analyses by treatment arm evaluated whether the docetaxel outcome varied with genotype.

Results: Of 475 white men with DNA samples, 270 patients (56.8%) inherited the adrenal-permissive genotype (≥1 HSD3B1[1245C] allele). Mean (SD) age was 63 (8.7) years. Freedom from CRPC at 2 years was diminished in men with low-volume disease with the adrenal-permissive vs adrenal-restrictive genotype: 51.0% (95% CI, 40.9%-61.2%) vs 70.5% (95% CI, 60.0%-80.9%) (P = .01). Overall survival at 5 years was also worse in men with low-volume disease with the adrenal-permissive genotype: 57.5% (95% CI, 47.4%-67.7%) vs 70.8% (95% CI, 60.3%-81.3%) (P = .03). Hazard ratios were 1.89 (95% CI, 1.13-3.14; P = .02) for CRPC and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.01-3.00; P = .045) for death. There was no association between genotype and outcomes in men with high-volume disease. There was no interaction between genotype and benefit from docetaxel.

Conclusions and Relevance: Inheritance of the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1 genotype is associated with earlier castration resistance and shorter overall survival in men with low-volume metastatic prostate cancer and may help identify men more likely to benefit from escalated androgen receptor axis inhibition beyond gonadal testosterone suppression.",0.348

We investigated the potential association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes with cabazitaxel toxicity, overall survival (OS) and pharmacokinetics (PK).

METHODS: A total of 128 cabazitaxel-treated mCRPC patients, of whom prospectively collected data on toxicity and OS were available and 24 mCRPC patients with available cabazitaxel PK measurements, were genotyped using genomic DNA obtained from EDTA blood. The SLCO1B1 (388A > G; *1B; rs2306283 and 521 T > C; *5; rs4149056 and haplotype SLCO1B1*15), SLCO1B3 (334 T > G; rs4149117), CYP3A4 (*22; rs35599367), CYP3A5 (*3; rs776746), ABCB1 (3435C > T; rs1045642), and TUBB1 (57 + 87A > C; rs463312) SNPs were tested for their association with clinical and PK parameters by univariate/multivariate logistic regression, log-rank test, or Kruskal-Wallis test.

RESULTS: The SLCO1B1*15 haplotype was significantly associated with a lower incidence of leukopenia and neutropenia (p = 0.020 and p = 0.028, respectively). Patients harboring a homozygous variant for SLCO1B1*1B experienced higher rate ≥ grade 3 (p = 0.042). None of the SNPs were associated with pharmacokinetics or OS.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, SLCO1B1 (SLCO1B1*15 and SLCO1B1*1B) was associated with cabazitaxel-induced adverse events in mCRPC patients. As the associations were opposite to previous studies in other drugs and contradicted an underlying pharmacokinetic rationale, these findings are likely to be false-positive and would ideally be validated with even larger (pharmacokinetic) cohorts.",0.644

Recent evidence suggests that combined inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) and AKT may be beneficial in mCRPC with PTEN loss.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: mCRPC patients who previously failed abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, received escalating doses of AZD5363 (capivasertib) starting at 320 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) given 4 days on and 3 days off, in combination with enzalutamide 160 mg daily. The co-primary endpoints were safety/tolerability and determining the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose; pharmacokinetics, antitumour activity, and exploratory biomarker analysis were also evaluated.

RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled, 15 received study treatment and 13 were assessable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Patients were treated at 320, 400, and 480 mg b.i.d. dose levels of capivasertib. The recommended phase II dose identified for capivasertib was 400 mg b.i.d. with 1/6 patients experiencing a DLT (maculopapular rash) at this level. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were hyperglycemia (26.7%) and rash (20%). Concomitant administration of enzalutamide significantly decreased plasma exposure of capivasertib, though this did not appear to impact pharmacodynamics. Three patients met the criteria for response (defined as prostate-specific antigen decline ≥50%, circulating tumour cell conversion, and/or radiological response). Responses were seen in patients with PTEN loss or activating mutations in AKT, low or absent AR-V7 expression, as well as those with an increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in post-exposure samples.

CONCLUSIONS: The combination of capivasertib and enzalutamide is tolerable and has antitumour activity, with all responding patients harbouring aberrations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Given that previous reports suggested that circulating tumor cell (CTC) AR-V7 detection is a poor prognostic indicator for the clinical efficacy of secondary hormone therapies, we conducted a prospective multicenter validation study.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PROPHECY ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02269982) is a multicenter, prospective-blinded study of men with high-risk mCRPC starting abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment. The primary objective was to validate the prognostic significance of baseline CTC AR-V7 on the basis of radiographic or clinical progression free-survival (PFS) by using the Johns Hopkins University modified-AdnaTest CTC AR-V7 mRNA assay and the Epic Sciences CTC nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein assay. Overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen responses were secondary end points.

RESULTS: We enrolled 118 men with mCRPC who were starting abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment. AR-V7 detection by both the Johns Hopkins and Epic AR-V7 assays was independently associated with shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1 to 3.3;<i>P</i>= .032] and 2.4 [95% CI, 1.1 to 5.1;<i>P</i>= .020], respectively) and OS (hazard ratio, 4.2 [95% CI, 2.1 to 8.5] and 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6 to 8.1], respectively) after adjusting for CTC number and clinical prognostic factors. Men with AR-V7-positive mCRPC had fewer confirmed prostate-specific antigen responses (0% to 11%) or soft tissue responses (0% to 6%). The observed percentage agreement between the two AR-V7 assays was 82%.

CONCLUSION: Detection of AR-V7 in CTCs by two blood-based assays is independently associated with shorter PFS and OS with abiraterone or enzalutamide, and such men with mCRPC should be offered alternative treatments.",0.570

N-myc is capable of driving NEPC progression. Alisertib inhibits the interaction between N-myc and its stabilizing factor Aurora-A, inhibiting N-myc signaling, and suppressing tumor growth.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty men were treated with alisertib 50 mg twice daily for 7 days every 21 days. Eligibility included metastatic prostate cancer and at least one: small-cell neuroendocrine morphology; ≥50% neuroendocrine marker expression; new liver metastases without PSA progression; or elevated serum neuroendocrine markers. The primary endpoint was 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Pretreatment biopsies were evaluated by whole exome and RNA-seq and patient-derived organoids were developed.

RESULTS: Median PSA was 1.13 ng/mL (0.01-514.2), number of prior therapies was 3, and 68% had visceral metastases. Genomic alterations involved<i>RB1</i>(55%),<i>TP53</i>(46%),<i>PTEN</i>(29%),<i>BRCA2</i>(29%), and<i>AR</i>(27%), and there was a range of androgen receptor signaling and NEPC marker expression. Six-month rPFS was 13.4% and median overall survival was 9.5 months (7.3-13). Exceptional responders were identified, including complete resolution of liver metastases and prolonged stable disease, with tumors suggestive of N-myc and Aurora-A overactivity. Patient organoids exhibited concordant responses to alisertib and allowed for the dynamic testing of Aurora-N-myc complex disruption.

SABR delivers precise, high-dose, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and achieves excellent rates of local control for primary tumors or metastases. A recent randomized phase II trial evaluated SABR in a group of patients with a small burden of oligometastatic disease (mostly with 1-3 metastatic lesions), and found that SABR was associated with benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival. The goal of this phase III trial is to assess the impact of SABR in patients with 4-10 metastatic cancer lesions.

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio between the control arm (consisting of standard of care palliative-intent treatments), and the SABR arm (consisting of standard of care treatment + SABR to all sites of known disease). Randomization will be stratified by two factors: histology (Group 1: prostate, breast, or renal; Group 2: all others), and type of pre-specified systemic therapy (Group 1: immunotherapy/targeted; Group 2: cytotoxic; Group 3: observation). SABR is to be completed within 2 weeks, allowing for rapid initiation of systemic therapy. Recommended SABR doses are 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 30 Gy in 3 fractions, or 35 Gy in 5 fractions, chosen to minimize risks of toxicity. The primary endpoint is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, time to development of new metastatic lesions, quality of life, and toxicity. Translational endpoints include assessment of circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA, and tumor tissue as prognostic and predictive markers, including assessment of immunological predictors of response and long-term survival.

DISCUSSION: This study will provide an assessment of the impact of SABR on clinical outcomes and quality of life, to determine if long-term survival can be achieved for selected patients with 4-10 oligometastatic lesions.

The purpose of this study was to understand whether other AR variants may be coexpressed with AR-V7 and promote resistance to AR-targeted therapies.<b>Experimental Design:</b>We utilized complementary short- and long-read sequencing of intact AR mRNA isoforms to characterize AR expression in CRPC models. Coexpression of AR-V7 and AR-V9 mRNA in CRPC metastases and circulating tumor cells was assessed by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, respectively.

We therefore conducted a phase Ib/II study of the combination of ipatasertib, an Akt inhibitor, with the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone in patients with mCRPC.<b>Patients and Methods:</b>Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to ipatasertib 400 mg, ipatasertib 200 mg, or placebo, with abiraterone 1,000 mg orally. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in the intent-to-treat population and in patients with PTEN-loss tumors.

RESULTS: rPFS was prolonged in the ipatasertib cohort versus placebo, with similar trends in overall survival and time-to-PSA progression. A larger rPFS prolongation for the combination was demonstrated in PTEN-loss tumors versus those without. The combination was well tolerated, with no treatment-related deaths.

CONCLUSIONS: In mCRPC, combined blockade with abiraterone and ipatasertib showed superior antitumor activity to abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-loss tumors.<i>See related commentary by Zhang et al., p. 901</i>.",0.605

The objective of the study was to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with outcomes for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 547 patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide from two prospective cohorts were evaluated. The HSD3B1 genotype was determined by targeted sequencing and/or TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. In cohort 1, patients were randomized to receive abiraterone + prednisone or enzalutamide. In cohort 2, patients received either agent according to investigator's choice. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, time to PSA progression (TTPP), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were determined. Associations between HSD3B1 genotypes and outcomes were evaluated via univariate Cox regression. Multivariable Cox model was used to determine the independent association of each covariate.

RESULTS: The HSD3B1 variant genotype (CC) was present in 15% of patients and was associated with worse TTP [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.67, P = 0.032] and PSA response rates (48% for CC versus 62% and 65% for AA and AC, respectively [P = 0.019]), with no significant difference in TTPP (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.66, P = 0.064). The effect of genotype was similar for treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide with a negative test for interaction for TTPP (P = 0.997) and TTP (P = 0.749). Multivariable analysis did not show a significant association between genotype and TTP or TTPP.

CONCLUSIONS: The HSD3B1 (CC) genotype was associated with shorter TTP and lower PSA response rate in patients with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. However, the CC genotype did not provide prognostic information beyond that conferred by standard clinical variables, suggesting that it may not be a suitable stand-alone biomarker in mCRPC.",0.790

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes for clinical recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The association of seven VEGF-A polymorphisms and their haplotypes with clinical recurrence (defined as the occurrence of local recurrence and/or distant metastases) in 496 prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy were investigated. Genotypes were determined by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays; haplotypes were analyzed using the Haploview program.

RESULTS: Within a median follow-up time of 80 months, 44 patients (9 %) developed clinical recurrences. Haplotype analysis showed two separate blocks of high-linkage disequilibrium, formed by five polymorphisms (- 2578C > A, - 2489C > T, - 1498C > T, - 634G > C, - 7C > T) upstream of the coding sequence (CCCCC, ATTGC, CCCGC, ATTGT) and two polymorphisms (936C > T, 1612G > A) downstream of the coding sequence (CA, CG, TG). Carriers of at least 1 copy of the ATTGC haplotype were at higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.83; 95 %CI 1.48-9.90, p = 0.006); for carriers of 2 copies, the HR was 4.85 (95 %CI 1.72-13.6; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, patients harboring at least one copy of the ATTGC haplotype remained at increased risk of recurrence (HR 3.63, 95 %CI 1.38-9.55, p = 0.009); in patients carrying 2 copies, the HR was 4.72 (95 %CI 1.64-13.6, p = 0.004).

We studied the irreversible, pan-isoform inhibitor of Class I PI-3K PX-866 singly (part A) and with abiraterone acetate (AA) in patients on AA with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (part B).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary endpoint was lack of progression at 12 weeks. Exploratory endpoints included changes in circulating tumor cells (CTC), pharmacodynamic studies on platelets (part A), and archival tumor exploration of PTEN as predictor of response (part B).

RESULTS: A total of 43 and 25 patients accrued to parts A and B, respectively. In part A, 14 (33%) patients were progression-free at 12 weeks, with 2 partial objective responses and 1 confirmed PSA response. Favorable CTC conversion (< 5 CTC/7.5 mL) occurred in 6 (24%) of 25 evaluable patients. In part B, 11 of 25 patients had measurable disease. Six (24%) patients were progression-free at 12 weeks.

Among 17 patients for whom PTEN testing was possible, 3 had PTEN homozygous deletion and 14 had no change. No correlation between PTEN status and response was seen.

CONCLUSIONS: PX-866 had modest single agent activity. Adding AA to PX-866 showed no evidence of resistance reversal.

Galeterone inhibits CYP17 and AR, and induces AR protein degradation. We hypothesized that galeterone would be clinically superior to enzalutamide in AR-V7-positive (AR-V7+) mCRPC.

OBJECTIVE: To screen and characterize AR-V7+ mCRPC, and evaluate galeterone compared with enzalutamide.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter randomized phase 3 trial; enzalutamide-, abiraterone-, and chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients had AR-V7 prescreening using a CTC-based mRNA assay.

INTERVENTION: AR-V7+ patients were randomized (1:1) to open-label galeterone or enzalutamide; planned sample size was 148.

OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Baseline AR-V7 status was correlated with patient characteristics.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 953 men were prescreened for AR-V7; 323 (34%) had detectable CTCs, and 73/323 had AR-V7 mRNA. The AR-V7+ prevalence was 8% (73/953; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6-10%). AR-V7 was associated with indicators of advanced and high-volume disease at baseline, including higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (p < 0.001), more bone metastases (p < 0.001), docetaxel for hormone-sensitive disease (p < 0.001), prior first-generation androgen deprivation therapy (p < 0.001), and shorter time from diagnosis to enrollment (p < 0.001). Of 73 eligible patients, 38 were randomized to galeterone (n=19) or enzalutamide (n=19); 35 dropped out before randomization. Owing to high censorship for the rPFS events, the data monitoring committee recommended early closure based on interim evidence that the primary endpoint would not be met. The PSA50 values were 2/16 (13%) and 8/19 (42%) for galeterone and enzalutamide respectively (proportion difference=-0.278, 95% CI -0.490 to 0.097).

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CTC mRNA AR-V7 in first-line mCRPC was 8% (95% CI 6-10%). AR-V7+ was associated with the characteristics of aggressive and advanced disease. These men had rapid disease progression. Development of galeterone will not be pursued.

PATIENT SUMMARY: Of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, 8% had the androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) blood biomarker. The AR-V7+ patients had features of aggressive disease. Thirty-eight men were treated with either galeterone or enzalutamide; the trial was stopped early prior to determining efficacy because too many patients transitioned off the trial due to advancing cancer before having required radiographs.",0.535

Interestingly, administration of the antioxidant vitamin E significantly increased prostate cancer risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), suggesting that our animal experiments may be relevant to humans. To determine whether NKX3.1 played a role in increased human prostate cancer risk associated with antioxidant administration in SELECT, we investigated the joint risk of antioxidant administration and NKX3.1 genotypes previously found to be associated with decreased NKX3.1 mRNA expression (rs11781886) or DNA-binding activity in vitro (rs2228013) in the SELECT biomarker case-cohort substudy (1,866 cases; 3,135 non-cases). Multivariable COX regression models were developed to determine the joint association of NKX3.1 genotypes with administration of vitamin E, selenium, or the combination, compared with placebo. The CC genotype at rs11781886 combined with selenium administration was associated with increased overall prostate cancer risk [HR, 1.676; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.011-2.777; P = 0.045] and low-grade prostate cancer risk (HR, 1.811; 95% CI, 1.016-3.228; P = 0.0441).

Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy. Olaparib was administered at 400 mg twice per day. The primary efficacy end point was tumor response rate.

RESULTS: A total of 298 patients received treatment and were evaluable. The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%).

CONCLUSION: Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.",0.455

Cabazitaxel might, however, remain effective in AR-V7-positive patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between AR-V7 expression in CTCs and resistance to cabazitaxel.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We selected patients with mCRPC from the multicenter, randomized, phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in mCRPC on the pharmacodynamic effects of budesonide on cabazitaxel (Jevtana) (CABARESC). Before the start of the first and third cabazitaxel cycle, CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch System. In patients with ≥10 CTCs in 7.5 ml blood at baseline, the expression of AR-V7 was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

OUTCOME MEASURES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary end point was the association between the AR-V7 status and the CTC response rate (decrease to fewer than five CTCs in 7.5 ml blood during treatment). Secondary end points were the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Analyses were performed using chi-square and log-rank tests.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: AR-V7 was detected in 16 of 29 patients (55%) with ≥10 CTCs and was more frequently found in abiraterone pretreated patients (5 of 5 [100%] treated vs 7 of 20 [35%] untreated; p=0.009). We found no differences in CTC and PSA RRs. The presence of AR-V7 in CTCs was not associated with progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.8) or overall survival (HR 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6-4.4).

CONCLUSIONS: The response to cabazitaxel seems to be independent of the AR-V7 status of CTCs from mCRPC patients. Consequently, cabazitaxel might be a valid treatment option for patients with AR-V7-positive CTCs.

PATIENT SUMMARY: Tools are needed to select specific treatments for specific patients at specific times. The presence of the gene AR-V7 in CTCs has been associated with resistance to anti-androgen receptor treatments. We investigated whether this holds true for cabazitaxel, but we found cabazitaxel to be effective independent of the presence of AR-V7.",0.392

This trial aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of pemetrexed in post-docetaxel CRPC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CRPC patients with progression after docetaxel (Taxotere) therapy received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) i.v. every 3 weeks. The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. A pharmacogenetic analysis of the reduced folate carrier-1 gene (RFC1) G80A polymorphism was also carried out.

RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled: median age 68 years, median baseline PSA 72 ng/ml, and median Karnofsky performance status of 90. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurred in 20 (43%) and four patients (8%), respectively. Confirmed >50% PSA decline occurred in four patients (8%), stable PSA lasting at least 12 weeks in 10 patients (20%). A significant relationship was observed between time from prior docetaxel therapy and overall survival. Pharmacogenetic analyses of RFC1 G80A genotype frequencies showed no relationship between genotypes and clinical efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed treatment of CRPC patients after docetaxel therapy was associated with only modest clinical activity. Further investigation of pemetrexed as a single agent in a nonenriched CRPC population is unlikely to add significant clinical benefit over that seen with traditional second-line chemotherapy agents such as mitoxantrone.",0.635

Its detection in blood samples of metastatic resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients may indicate the presence of circulating tumour cells with this genetic alteration and may predict taxane resistance. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated TMPRSS2-ERG expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumour tissue from mCPRC patients treated with taxanes. We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 24 healthy controls, 50 patients treated with docetaxel, and 22 with cabazitaxel. TMPRSS2-ERG was detected in 0%, 16%, and 22.7% of them, respectively. In docetaxel-treated patients TMPRSS2-ERG detection correlated with lower prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (12.5% vs 68.3%, p=0.005), PSA-progression-free survival (PFS; 3.1 mo vs 7.5 mo, p<0.001), clinical/radiological-PFS (3.1 mo vs 8.2 mo, p<0.001), and it was independently associated with PSA-PFS (hazard ratio 3.7; p=0.009) and clinical/radiological-PFS (hazard ratio 6.3; p<0.001). Moreover, TMPRSS2-ERG also predicted low PSA-PFS to cabazitaxel. At progression, a switch from negative to positive TMPRSS2-ERG was observed in 41% of patients with undetected TMPRSS2-ERG at the baseline sample. Tissue TMPRSS2-ERG expression correlated with lower PSA-PFS (p=0.02) to docetaxel. Our findings support the potential role of TMPRSS2-ERG detection as a biomarker to tailor treatment strategies.

PATIENT SUMMARY: Taxanes are the most active chemotherapy agents in metastatic resistant prostate cancer. However, not all patients respond to this therapy. In the present study we show that the detection of TMPRSS2-ERG in blood from metastatic resistant prostate cancer patients predicts resistance to docetaxel and it may be useful to select treatment and to avoid possible toxicities in refractory patients.",0.271

This study was designed to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of Mel-18 in patients with prostate cancer. A total of 539 native Japanese subjects consisting of 393 prostate cancer patients and 146 controls were enrolled in this study. Mel-18 genotyping was analyzed using a PCR-RFLP method and an automated sequencer using the GENESCAN software. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Mel-18 expression was diminished in high grade and high stage prostate cancers. Moreover, patients with positive Mel-18 expression had significantly longer PSA recurrence-free survival than patients negative for Mel-18 expression (p=0.038). A Mel-18 1805A/G SNP was located in the 3' untranslated region and was predicted to alter the secondary structure of the mRNA. Mel-18 mRNA expression of the 1805A allele was clearly higher than expression of the 1805G allele by allele specific quantitative RT-PCR. In multivariate analysis, a homozygous G allele genotype and negative Mel-18 expression were independent risk factors predicting high PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy, with HRs of 2.757 (p=0.022) and 2.271 (p=0.045), respectively. Moreover, the G allele was also an independent predictor of poor cancer-specific survival with an HR of 4.658 (p=0.019) for patients with stage D2 prostate cancer.

Consequently, there is a need to identify immune biomarkers to select patients who will benefit from such therapies. Such predictive biomarkers may be also used as surrogates for overall survival (OS). We have recently found correlations between immunologic parameters and clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients who had been vaccinated with a HER-2/neu hybrid polypeptide vaccine (AE37) and received one booster 6 months post-primary vaccinations. Herein, we aimed to expand these retrospective analyses by studying the predictive impact of HLA-A*24 and HLA-DRB1*11 alleles, which are expressed at high frequencies among responders in our vaccinated patients, for clinical and immunological responses to AE37 vaccination. Our data show an increased OS of patients expressing the HLA-DRB1*11 or HLA-A*24 alleles, or both. Vaccine-induced immunological responses, measured as interferon γ (IFN-γ) responses in vitro or delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in vivo, were also higher in these patients and inversely correlated with suppressor elements. Preexisting (i.e., before vaccinations with AE37) levels of vaccine-specific IFN-γ immunity and plasma TGF-β, among the HLA-A*24 and/or HLA-DRB1*11 positive patients, were strong indicators for immunological responses to AE37 treatment.

METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRPC pretreated with docetaxel-based regimen were eligible. Performance status of 0-1 and adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function were required. Primary end point was time to progression. Treatment consisted of carboplatin (starting dose equal to area under the curve (AUC of 5) intravenously every 21 days along with oral everolimus 5 mg once daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily.

RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median age of 69 years with 8 patients of African American origin. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in 4 of 6 initial patients required dose adjustment of carboplatin to AUC of 4 for subsequent patients. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions between carboplatin and everolimus.

We assessed the association between ERG rearrangement status and clinical benefit from abiraterone acetate.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: COU-AA-302 is a phase III trial comparing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. ERG status was evaluated by FISH on archival tumors. End points included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), rate of ≥50% PSA decline from baseline, and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to evaluate association with time-to-event measures and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel for PSA response.

RESULTS: ERG status was defined for 348 of 1,088 intention-to-treat patients. ERG was rearranged in 121 of 348 patients with confirmed ERG status (35%). Cancers with an ERG fusion secondary to deletion of 21q22 and increased copy number of fusion sequences (class 2+ Edel) had a greater improvement in rPFS after abiraterone acetate and prednisone [22 vs. 5.4 months; HR (95% confidence interval, CI), 0.31 (0.15-0.68); P = 0.0033] than cancers with no ERG fusion [16.7 vs. 8.3 months; 0.53 (0.38-0.74); P = 0.0002] or other classes of ERG rearrangement. There was also greater benefit in this subgroup for TTPP.

CONCLUSIONS: Both ERG-rearranged and wild-type cancers had a significant improvement in rPFS with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in the COU-AA-302 trial.

This study evaluated the potential activity of lapatinib in men with biochemically-relapsed androgen-dependent (stage D0) prostate cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a rising PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer were enrolled. A PSA doubling time (PSADT) <12 months was required. Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg orally daily. Outcome measures were changes in PSA kinetics. Primary tumor blocks were obtained and assessed for EGFR expression, EGFR Q787Q polymorphism, and Kras 38 mutational status.

RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled (14 ineligible), resulting in 35 patients for analysis. No PSA response was observed; best response was stable disease (n = 28, 80.0%). Pretreatment average slope was 0.19 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 3.70 months), in contrast to on-treatment average slope of 0.13 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 5.44 months) using linear mixed effects models (P = 0.006).

CONCLUSIONS: Among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in<i>BRCA1</i>,<i>BRCA2</i>, or<i>ATM</i>and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib.

The anti-programmed death receptor 1 inhibitor nivolumab previously showed activity in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colon cancer. We hypothesized that nivolumab would have activity in patients with MMR-deficient, noncolorectal tumors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with relapsed or refractory tumors, good end-organ function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤ 1 underwent tumor biopsy for centralized screening of molecular alterations. MMR deficiency was defined by complete loss of nuclear expression of<i>MLH1</i>or<i>MSH2</i>MMR gene products by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with MMR-deficient colorectal cancer were excluded. Nivolumab, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (28-day cycles) and 480 mg every 4 weeks after cycle 4, was administered intravenously. Disease reassessment was performed every 2 cycles. The primary end point was RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR).

RESULTS: Two percent of 4,902 screened patients had an MMR-deficient cancer by IHC. Forty-two evaluable patients were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years and a median of 3 prior therapies. The most common histologies were endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 13), prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 5), and uterine carcinosarcoma (n = 4). ORR was 36% (15 of 42 patients). An additional 21% of patients had stable disease. The estimated 6-, 12-, and 18-month progression-free survival rates were 51.3% (90% CI, 38.2% to 64.5%), 46.2% (90% CI, 33.1% to 59.3%), and 31.4% (90% CI, 18.7% to 44.2%), respectively. Median overall survival was 17.3 months. Toxicity was predominantly low grade.

CONCLUSION: A variety of refractory cancers (2.0% of those screened) had MMR deficiency as defined in NCI-MATCH. Nivolumab has promising activity in MMR-deficient noncolorectal cancers of a wide variety of histopathologic types.",0.367

Oncology,"Clarke, N.; Wiechno, P.; Alekseev, B.; Sala, N.; Jones, R.; Kocak, I.; Chiuri, VE.; Jassem, J.; Fléchon, A.; Redfern, C.; Goessl, C.; Burgents, J.; Kozarski, R.; Hodgson, D.; Learoyd, M.; Saad, F.","BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations have a better response to treatment with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib than patients without HRR mutations. Preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of HRR mutation status.

METHODS: We carried out this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries across Europe and North America. Eligible male patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and were candidates for abiraterone treatment. Patients were excluded if they had received more than two previous lines of chemotherapy, or had previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system, without stratification, to receive oral olaparib 300 mg twice daily or placebo. All patients received oral abiraterone 1000 mg once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01972217, and is no longer recruiting patients.

FINDINGS: Between Nov 25, 2014, and July 14, 2015, 171 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive olaparib and abiraterone (n=71) or placebo and abiraterone (n=71). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Sept 22, 2017. Median rPFS was 13·8 months (95% CI 10·8-20·4) with olaparib and abiraterone and 8·2 months (5·5-9·7) with placebo and abiraterone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·44-0·97, p=0·034). The most common grade 1-2 adverse events were nausea (26 [37%] patients in the olaparib group vs 13 [18%] patients in the placebo group), constipation (18 [25%] vs eight [11%]), and back pain (17 [24%] vs 13 [18%]). 38 (54%) of 71 patients in the olaparib and abiraterone group and 20 (28%) of 71 patients in the placebo and abiraterone group had grade 3 or worse adverse events, including anaemia (in 15 [21%] of 71 patients vs none of 71), pneumonia (four [6%] vs three [4%]), and myocardial infarction (four [6%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported by 24 (34%) of 71 patients receiving olaparib and abiraterone (seven of which were related to treatment) and 13 (18%) of 71 patients receiving placebo and abiraterone (one of which was related to treatment). One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the olaparib and abiraterone group.

INTERPRETATION: Olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone. More serious adverse events were observed in patients who received olaparib and abiraterone than abiraterone alone. Our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Because osimertinib prolongs PFS compared with erlotinib, this trial was designed to study the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab as first-line treatment.Objectives: To determine the safety and tolerability of osimertinib and bevacizumab combination treatment and assess the 12-month PFS of the combination in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers.Design, Setting, and Particiants: From August 15, 2016, to May 15, 2018, 49 patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers were enrolled in this interventional clinical trial, conducted at a single academic cancer center. In the phase 1 portion of the study, a standard 3 + 3 dose de-escalation design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose of osimertinib and bevacizumab. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose defined in the phase 1 portion. Statistical analysis was performed from August 1 to October 1, 2019.Interventions: All patients received osimertinib, 80 mg daily, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the study was to determine the number of patients receiving the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab who were progression free at 12 months. Secondary end points included overall response rate, median PFS, overall survival, and definition of the toxic effects of the combination treatment.Results: Among the 49 patients in the study (34 women; median age, 60 years [range, 36-83 years]), PFS at 12 months was 76% (95% CI, 65%-90%). The overall response rate was 80% (95% CI, 67%-91%), and median PFS was 19 months (95% CI, 15-24 months). Of the 6 patients with measurable central nervous system disease, all had a partial or complete central nervous system response. Persistent detection of EGFR-mutant circulating tumor (ct)DNA at 6 weeks was associated with shorter median PFS (clearance at 6 weeks, 16.2 months [95% CI, 13 months to not reached]; and no clearance at 6 weeks, 9.8 months [95% CI, 4 months to not reached]; P = .04) and median overall survival (clearance at 6 weeks, not reached; and no clearance at 6 weeks, 10.1 months [95% CI, 6 months to not reached]; P = .002). Identified mechanisms of resistance included squamous cell transformation (n = 2) pleomorphic transformation (n = 1), and acquired EGFR L718Q (n = 1) and C797S (n = 1) mutations.Conclusions and Relevance: The combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab met the study's prespecified effectiveness end point. Persistent EGFR-mutant circulating tumor DNA at 6 weeks was associated with early progression and shorter survival. A randomized phase 3 study comparing osimertinib and bevacizumab with osimertinib alone is planned.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02803203.",0.592

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical activity and pharmacodynamic/pharmacogenetic profile of docetaxel plus prednisone in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide in mCRPC patients.METHODS: Forty-one chemotherapy-naive patients received docetaxel (60 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks up to 12 cycles) and, from day 2, prednisone 10 mg/day, celecoxib 400 mg/day, and metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day, continuously. Plasma VEGF and bFGF were detected by ELISA. Real-time PCR-SNP analysis of VEGF gene was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT SDS and TaqMan SNP genotyping.RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients were free of progression at 6 months. A decrease in prostate-specific antigen ≥50% was observed in 82% of 39 evaluable patients, with a median time to progression of 12.3 months. Grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (5%), thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and stomatitis (2.5%).

The mean follow-up was 6.3 years. Tumor volume of lymph node metastases was measured using the grid method.RESULTS: p53 immunoreactivity was detected in 109 of 211 primary tumors (52%) and 83 of 144 matched regional lymph node metastases (58%); this expression was strongly concordant (correlation coefficient 0.53; P = 0.0001). Overexpression of p53 protein in lymph node metastases was associated with distant metastasis free survival by univariate analysis (P = 0.03), but did not reach statistical significance by multivariate analysis (P = 0.07). Regional lymph node cancer volume was the single most important predictor of distant metastases after adjusting for Gleason score, DNA ploidy, and p53 expression.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that assessment of biologic changes (including p53 alterations in regional lymph node metastases) could be of value in the assessment of the biologic aggressiveness of prostate carcinoma, whereas p53 expression in the primary tumor does not appear to influence patient outcome.",0.308

The primary end point of this study was change in serum PSADT. Additional secondary and exploratory objectives were to evaluate the safety of pomegranate juice and to determine the interaction of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype and pomegranate treatment on PSADT.RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-three eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the active and placebo groups with a ratio of 2:1 (extract N=102; placebo N=64; juice N=17).

In this study, we used a three-phase design. In phases I and II prostate cancer patient cohort, 578 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 45 genes of the Wnt signaling pathway were analyzed in 1762 localized prostate cancer patients. Twelve SNPs from four regions were significantly associated with aggressive disease, among which, three linked SNPs in CSNK1A1 at 5q32 (represented by rs752822) may differentiate GS 4+3 from GS 3+4 patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.12-1.87, P = 4.76×10(-3)).

This phase II study assessed the outcome and predictive factors for prognosis and toxicity following intermittent chemotherapy with docetaxel, estramustine phosphate, and carboplatin (DEC) in patients with CRPC.METHODS: Thirty-five patients were treated with a DEC regimen that consisted of a 28-day cycle of drugs as follows: docetaxel (60 mg/m(2) on day 1), carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) and estramustine phosphate (560 mg daily). Treatment was continued intermittently. The end point was to test the effect of DEC on the response rate and overall survival (OS). Statistical correlations between the outcomes and predictive factors, including clinical parameters and 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to drug metabolism, were assessed.RESULTS: Prostate-specific antigen levels decreased by more than 30% in 65.7% of the patients. The median OS following DEC was 17.8 months, and the median total time of chemotherapy holiday was 7.7 months (range 1.7-35.8). On multivariate analysis, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.007).

The objectives of this analysis were to discover SNPs associated with docetaxel-induced neuropathy and mechanistically validate these associations in preclinical models of drug-induced neuropathy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A genome-wide association study was conducted in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone and randomized to bevacizumab or placebo on CALGB 90401. SNPs were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap610-Quad platform followed by rigorous quality control. The inference was conducted on the cumulative dose at occurrence of grade 3+ sensory neuropathy using a cause-specific hazard model that accounted for early treatment discontinuation. Genes with SNPs significantly associated with neuropathy were knocked down in cellular and mouse models of drug-induced neuropathy.RESULTS: A total of 498,081 SNPs were analyzed in 623 Caucasian patients, 50 (8%) of whom experienced grade 3+ neuropathy. The 1,000 SNPs most associated with neuropathy clustered in relevant pathways including neuropathic pain and axonal guidance. An SNP in VAC14 (rs875858) surpassed genome-wide significance (P = 2.12 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, adjusted P = 5.88 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). siRNA knockdown of VAC14 in stem cell-derived peripheral neuronal cells increased docetaxel sensitivity as measured by decreased neurite processes (P = 0.0015) and branches (P < 0.0001). Prior to docetaxel treatment, VAC14 heterozygous mice had greater nociceptive sensitivity than wild-type litter mate controls (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: VAC14 should be prioritized for further validation of its potential role as a predictor of docetaxel-induced neuropathy and biomarker for treatment individualization.

The purpose of this phase II study was to evaluate mechanisms of resistance to more complete androgen synthesis inhibition with abiraterone and dutasteride.<b>Experimental Design:</b>Eligible patients with metastatic CRPC underwent a baseline metastasis biopsy. Patients received abiraterone and prednisone for two 4-week cycles. After this time, high-dose dutasteride (3.5 mg daily) was added. Patients continued therapy until study withdrawal or radiographic progression. Repeat metastasis biopsy was obtained at progression. The primary endpoint was to assess mechanisms of resistance. Serum hormone and abiraterone levels were assessed. Tissue was assessed for androgen receptor (AR) and AR splice variant-7 (ARV7) expression.<b>Results:</b>Forty patients were enrolled. Sixty percent (<i>n</i>= 24) achieved a ≥50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The median time to radiographic progression was 11 months. Nearly all baseline (<i>n</i>= 29 of 31) and posttreatment (<i>n</i>= 16 of 16) tumors tested for AR nuclear expression were positive. Of those tested, ARV7 expression was present in 48% (<i>n</i>= 10 of 21) of baseline and 42% (<i>n</i>= 5 of 12) of treatment discontinuation specimens. Compared with patients with higher serum abiraterone levels at treatment discontinuation, patients with lower levels had higher circulating androgens.<b>Conclusions:</b>Despite increased androgen synthesis inhibition, we demonstrate that tumor AR axis remains important in disease progression. We highlight that abiraterone metabolism and pharmacokinetics may play a role in resistance. The noncomparative design limits conclusions on the efficacy of dual therapy with abiraterone and dutasteride, but the results support development of further multifaceted approaches toward AR inhibition.<i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 935-45. ©2016 AACR</i>.",0.366

We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate.

RESULTS: The immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be used not only for the biochemical profiling of the individual, but also, being living cells, can provide insights into the individuals response to ionizing radiation exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study attempts to link the biochemical profile of lymphocytes within PBMCs obtained through Raman spectroscopy to in vitro measures of low-dose (<0.5Gy) DNA damage response and cytogenetic metrics of radiosensitivity in a cohort of healthy controls and prostate cancer patients (from CTRIAL-IE(ICORG) 08-17, NCT00951535). All parallel metrics to the Raman spectra of the cells were obtained ex vivo in cycling peripheral blood lymphocytes, with radiosensitivity estimated using the G2 chromosomal assay and DNA damage assessed using γH2AX fluorescence. Spectra from a total of 26 healthy volunteers and 22 prostate cancer patients were obtained.

RESULTS: The links between both measures of cellular response to ionizing radiation and the Raman spectra were modeled using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support-vector regression (SVR). It was found that neither regression approach could predict radiation-induced G2 score well, but could predict γH2AX MFI with the SVR outperforming PLSR, implying a non-linear relationship between spectral measurements and measures of DNA damage.

CONCLUSIONS: Raman spectroscopy of PBMCs represents a label-free approach for prediction of DNA damage levels for either prospective or retrospective analysis.",0.139

We aim to evaluate the association between<i>AR</i>CN as a continuous variable and clinical outcome.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PCR2023 was an international, multi-institution, open-label, phase II study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone (AAP) or abiraterone acetate plus dexamethasone that included plasma<i>AR</i>assessment as a predefined exploratory secondary end point. Plasma<i>AR</i>CN data (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01867710) from this study (n = 133) were pooled with data from the following three other cohorts: cohort A, which was treated with either AAP or enzalutamide (n = 73); the PREMIERE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02288936) of biomarkers for enzalutamide (n = 94); and a phase II trial from British Columbia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02125357) that randomly assigned men to either AAP or enzalutamide (n = 201). The primary outcome measures for the biomarker analysis were overall survival and progression-free survival.

RESULTS: Using multivariable fractional polynomials analysis using Cox regression models, a nonlinear relationship between plasma<i>AR</i>CN and outcome was identified for overall survival, where initially for small incremental gains in CN there was a large added hazard ratio that plateaued at higher CN. The CN cut point associated with the highest local hazard ratio was 1.92. A similar nonlinear association was observed with progression-free survival. In an exploratory analysis of PCR2023, the time from start of long-term androgen-deprivation therapy to start of AAP or abiraterone acetate plus dexamethasone was significantly shorter in patients with plasma<i>AR</i>CN of 1.92 or greater than patients with plasma<i>AR</i>CN of less than 1.92 (43<i>v</i>130 weeks, respectively;<i>P</i>= .005). This was confirmed in cohort A (<i>P</i>= .003), the PREMIERE cohort (<i>P</i>= .03), and the British Colombia cohort (<i>P</i>= .003).

CONCLUSION: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can be dichotomized by a plasma<i>AR</i>CN cut point of 1.92. Plasma<i>AR</i>CN value of 1.92 or greater identifies aggressive disease that is poorly responsive to AR targeting and is associated with a prior short response to primary androgen-deprivation therapy.",0.417

Objective: To validate the GC in the context of a randomized phase 3 trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This ancillary study used RP specimens from the phase 3 placebo-controlled NRG/RTOG 9601 randomized clinical trial conducted from March 1998 to March 2003. The specimens were centrally reviewed, and RNA was extracted from the highest-grade tumor available in 2019 with a median follow-up of 13 years. Clinical-grade whole transcriptomes from samples passing quality control were assigned GC scores (scale, 0-1). A National Clinical Trials Network-approved prespecified statistical plan included the primary objective of validating the independent prognostic ability of GC for DM, with secondary end points of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival (OS). Data were analyzed from September 2019 to December 2019.

Intervention: Salvage radiotherapy (sRT) with or without 2 years of bicalutamide.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The preplanned primary end point of this study was the independent association of the GC with the development of DM.

Results: In this ancillary study of specimens from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial, GC scores were generated from 486 of 760 randomized patients with a median follow-up of 13 years; samples from a total of 352 men (median [interquartile range] age, 64.5 (60-70) years; 314 White [89.2%] participants) passed microarray quality control and comprised the final cohort for analysis. On multivariable analysis, the GC (continuous variable, per 0.1 unit) was independently associated with DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32; P = .006), PCSM (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.63; P < .001), and OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29; P = .002) after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T stage, margin status, entry prostate-specific antigen, and treatment arm. Although the original planned analysis was not powered to detect a treatment effect interaction by GC score, the estimated absolute effect of bicalutamide on 12-year OS was less when comparing patients with lower vs higher GC scores (2.4% vs 8.9%), which was further demonstrated in men receiving early sRT at a prostate-specific antigen level lower than 0.7 ng/mL (-7.8% vs 4.6%).

Conclusions and Relevance: This ancillary validation study of the Decipher GC in a randomized trial cohort demonstrated association of the GC with DM, PCSM, and OS independent of standard clinicopathologic variables. These results suggest that not all men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after surgery benefit equally from the addition of hormone therapy to sRT.

To test this hypothesis, the phase II TRITON2 study of rucaparib included patients with mCRPC and deleterious non-<i>BRCA</i>DDR gene alterations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TRITON2 enrolled patients who had progressed on one or two lines of next-generation androgen receptor-directed therapy and one taxane-based chemotherapy for mCRPC. Key endpoints were investigator-assessed radiographic response per modified RECIST/PCWG3 and PSA response (≥50% decrease from baseline).

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that polymorphisms in estrogen synthesis and estrogen targets (i.e., CYP19 and ERα) would be linked to interindividual variation in CRPC risk, docetaxel response, and overall survival in men with CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CRPC (n=115) treated with docetaxel, single-agent thalidomide (n=42), or healthy controls (n=289) were genotyped for the CYP19 R264C (rs700519) and the ERα PvuII T>C (rs2234693) and XbaI A>G (rs9340799) polymorphisms.

RESULTS: Patients carrying two copies of ERα polymorphisms had shorter progression-free survival on docetaxel than other patients (median survival difference ≥ 3.1 months; P ≤ 0.036). When the analysis was limited to nonobese patients, the relationship between the ERα XbaI A>G polymorphism and PFS improved (median survival difference = 3.5 months; P = 0.0078). The CYP19 R264C variant was related to the duration of survival after docetaxel in patients who were >70 years old (median survival difference =10.6 months; P=0.041). Both ERα polymorphisms were also associated with increases in CRPC risk [P ≤ 0.032; double variants vs. wild-type odds ratio ≥ 2.6], and the association with the ERα PvuII T>C also improved in those men who were <70 years old (P = 0.0073; odds ratio = 3.0).

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that estrogen-related genetic variation affects docetaxel clinical response and that this relationship is dependent on age and body-type in men with CRPC. Moreover, this study suggests ERα polymorphisms confer risk of developing prostate cancer, especially in men under 70 years of age.",0.370

However, abiraterone increases progesterone, which can activate certain mutant androgen receptors (AR) identified previously in flutamide-resistant tumors. Therefore, we sought to determine if CYP17A1 inhibitor treatment selects for progesterone-activated mutant ARs.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AR was examined by targeted sequencing in metastatic tumor biopsies from 18 patients with CRPC who were progressing on a CYP17A1 inhibitor (17 on abiraterone, 1 on ketoconazole), alone or in combination with dutasteride, and by whole-exome sequencing in residual tumor in one patient treated with neoadjuvant leuprolide plus abiraterone.

RESULTS: The progesterone-activated T878A-mutant AR was present at high allele frequency in 3 of the 18 CRPC cases. It was also present in one focus of resistant tumor in the neoadjuvant-treated patient, but not in a second clonally related resistant focus that instead had lost one copy of PTEN and both copies of CHD1. The T878A mutation appeared to be less common in the subset of patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride, and transfection studies showed that dutasteride was a more potent direct antagonist of the T878A versus the wild-type AR.

A published report showed that men with prostate cancer who were resistant to the second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide had increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on circulating antigen-presenting cells. We hypothesized that the addition of PD-1 inhibition in these patients could induce a meaningful cancer response.

METHODS: We evaluated enzalutamide plus the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a single-arm phase II study of 28 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mprogressing on enzalutamide alone. Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous was given every 3 weeks for four doses with enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50%. Secondary endpoints were objective response, PSA progression-free survival (PFS), time to subsequent treatment, and time to death. Baseline tumor biopsies were obtained when feasible, and samples were sequenced and evaluated for the expression of PD-L1, microsatellite instability (MSI), mutational and neoepitope burdens.

RESULTS: Five (18%) of 28 patients had a PSA decline of ≥50%. Three (25%) of 12 patients with measurable disease at baseline achieved an objective response. Of the five responders, two continue with PSA and radiographic response after 39.3 and 37.8 months. For the entire cohort, median follow-up was 37 months, and median PSA PFS time was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 9.9 months). Time to subsequent treatment was 7.21 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 11.1 months). Median overall survival for all patients was 21.9 months (95% CI: 14.7 to 28 .4 months), versus 41.7 months (95% CI: 22.16 to not reached (NR)) in the responders. Of the three responders with baseline biopsies, one had MSI high disease with mutations consistent with DNA-repair defects. None had detectable PD-L1 expression.

CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab has activity in mCRPC when added to enzalutamide. Responses were deep and durable and did not require tumor PD-L1 expression or DNA-repair defects.

Principal component analysis on the mCRPC plasma methylome indicated that the main contributor to methylation variance (principal component one, or PC1) was strongly correlated with genomically determined tumor fraction (r = -0.96; P < 10-8) and characterized by hypermethylation of targets of the polycomb repressor complex 2 components. Further deconvolution of the PC1 top-correlated segments revealed that these segments are comprised of methylation patterns specific to either prostate cancer or prostate normal epithelium. To extract information specific to an individual's cancer, we then focused on an orthogonal methylation signature, which revealed enrichment for androgen receptor binding sequences and hypomethylation of these segments associated with AR copy number gain.
