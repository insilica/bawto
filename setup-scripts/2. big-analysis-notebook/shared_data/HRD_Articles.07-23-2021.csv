Oncology,"Mateo, J.; Porta, N.; Bianchini, D.; McGovern, U.; Elliott, T.; Jones, R.; Syndikus, I.; Ralph, C.; Jain, S.; Varughese, M.; Parikh, O.; Crabb, S.; Robinson, A.; McLaren, D.; Birtle, A.; Tanguay, J.; Miranda, S.; Figueiredo, I.; Seed, G.; Bertan, C.; Flohr, P.; Ebbs, B.; Rescigno, P.; Fowler, G.; Ferreira, A.; Riisnaes, R.; Pereira, R.; Curcean, A.; Chandler, R.; Clarke, M.; Gurel, B.; Crespo, M.; Nava Rodrigues, D.; Sandhu, S.; Espinasse, A.; Chatfield, P.; Tunariu, N.; Yuan, W.; Hall, E.; Carreira, S.; de Bono, JS.","BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is enriched in DNA damage response (DDR) gene aberrations. The TOPARP-B trial aims to prospectively validate the association between DDR gene aberrations and response to olaparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

METHODS: In this open-label, investigator-initiated, randomised phase 2 trial following a selection (or pick-the-winner) design, we recruited participants from 17 UK hospitals. Men aged 18 years or older with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with one or two taxane chemotherapy regimens and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less had tumour biopsies tested with targeted sequencing. Patients with DDR gene aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated minimisation method, with balancing for circulating tumour cell count at screening, to receive 400 mg or 300 mg olaparib twice daily, given continuously in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to dose allocation. The primary endpoint of confirmed response was defined as a composite of all patients presenting with any of the following outcomes: radiological objective response (as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1), a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 50% or more (PSA50) from baseline, or conversion of circulating tumour cell count (from ≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline to <5 cells per 7·5 mL blood). A confirmed response in a consecutive assessment after at least 4 weeks was required for each component. The primary analysis was done in the evaluable population. If at least 19 (43%) of 44 evaluable patients in a dose cohort responded, then the dose cohort would be considered successful. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01682772. Recruitment for the trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing.

FINDINGS: 711 patients consented for targeted screening between April 1, 2015, and Aug 30, 2018. 161 patients had DDR gene aberrations, 98 of whom were randomly assigned and treated (49 patients for each olaparib dose), with 92 evaluable for the primary endpoint (46 patients for each olaparib dose). Median follow-up was 24·8 months (IQR 16·7-35·9). Confirmed composite response was achieved in 25 (54·3%; 95% CI 39·0-69·1) of 46 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort, and 18 (39·1%; 25·1-54·6) of 46 evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort. Radiological response was achieved in eight (24·2%; 11·1-42·3) of 33 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort and six (16·2%; 6·2-32·0) of 37 in the 300 mg cohort; PSA50 response was achieved in 17 (37·0%; 23·2-52·5) of 46 and 13 (30·2%; 17·2-46·1) of 43; and circulating tumour cell count conversion was achieved in 15 (53·6%; 33·9-72·5) of 28 and 13 (48·1%; 28·7-68·1) of 27. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event in both cohorts was anaemia (15 [31%] of 49 patients in the 300 mg cohort and 18 [37%] of 49 in the 400 mg cohort). 19 serious adverse reactions were reported in 13 patients. One death possibly related to treatment (myocardial infarction) occurred after 11 days of treatment in the 300 mg cohort.

INTERPRETATION: Olaparib has antitumour activity against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with DDR gene aberrations, supporting the implementation of genomic stratification of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in clinical practice.

Patients and Methods Patients underwent metastatic site biopsy and were stratified by ETS status and randomly assigned to abiraterone plus prednisone without (arm A) or with veliparib (arm B). Primary objectives were: confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) and whether ETS fusions predicted response. Secondary objectives were: safety, measurable disease RR (mRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and molecular biomarker analysis. A total of 148 patients were randomly assigned to detect a 20% PSA RR improvement. Results A total of 148 patients with mCRPC were randomly assigned: arm A, n = 72; arm B, n = 76. There were no differences in PSA RR (63.9% v 72.4%; P = .27), mRR (45.0% v 52.2%; P = .51), or median PFS (10.1 v 11 months; P = .99). ETS fusions did not predict response. Exploratory analysis of tumor sequencing (80 patients) revealed: 41 patients (51%) were ETS positive, 20 (25%) had DNA-damage repair defect (DRD), 41 (51%) had AR amplification or copy gain, 34 (43%) had PTEN mutation, 33 (41%) had TP53 mutation, 39 (49%) had PIK3CA pathway activation, and 12 (15%) had WNT pathway alteration. Patients with DRD had significantly higher PSA RR (90% v 56.7%; P = .007) and mRR (87.5% v 38.6%; P = .001), PSA decline ≥ 90% (75% v 25%; P = .001), and longer median PFS (14.5 v 8.1 months; P = .025) versus those with wild-type tumors. Median PFS was longer in patients with normal PTEN (13.5 v 6.7 months; P = .02), TP53 (13.5 v 7.7 months; P = .01), and PIK3CA (13.8 v 8.3 months; P = .03) versus those with mutation or activation. In multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical covariates, DRD association with PFS remained significant. Conclusion Veliparib and ETS status did not affect response.

The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported.

METHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive olaparib (256 patients) or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy (131 patients). Cohort A included 245 patients with at least one alteration in<i>BRCA1</i>,<i>BRCA2</i>, or<i>ATM</i>, and cohort B included 142 patients with at least one alteration in any of the other 12 prespecified genes. Crossover to olaparib was allowed after imaging-based disease progression for patients who met certain criteria. Overall survival in cohort A, a key secondary end point, was analyzed with the use of an alpha-controlled, stratified log-rank test at a data maturity of approximately 60%. The primary and other key secondary end points were reported previously.

RESULTS: The median duration of overall survival in cohort A was 19.1 months with olaparib and 14.7 months with control therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.97; P = 0.02). In cohort B, the median duration of overall survival was 14.1 months with olaparib and 11.5 months with control therapy. In the overall population (cohorts A and B), the corresponding durations were 17.3 months and 14.0 months. Overall, 86 of 131 patients (66%) in the control group crossed over to receive olaparib (56 of 83 patients [67%] in cohort A). A sensitivity analysis that adjusted for crossover to olaparib showed hazard ratios for death of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.91) in cohort A, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.11 to 5.98) in cohort B, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.06) in the overall population.

CONCLUSIONS: Among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in<i>BRCA1</i>,<i>BRCA2</i>, or<i>ATM</i>and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib.

Preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of HRR mutation status.

METHODS: We carried out this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries across Europe and North America. Eligible male patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and were candidates for abiraterone treatment. Patients were excluded if they had received more than two previous lines of chemotherapy, or had previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system, without stratification, to receive oral olaparib 300 mg twice daily or placebo. All patients received oral abiraterone 1000 mg once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01972217, and is no longer recruiting patients.

FINDINGS: Between Nov 25, 2014, and July 14, 2015, 171 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive olaparib and abiraterone (n=71) or placebo and abiraterone (n=71). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Sept 22, 2017. Median rPFS was 13·8 months (95% CI 10·8-20·4) with olaparib and abiraterone and 8·2 months (5·5-9·7) with placebo and abiraterone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·44-0·97, p=0·034). The most common grade 1-2 adverse events were nausea (26 [37%] patients in the olaparib group vs 13 [18%] patients in the placebo group), constipation (18 [25%] vs eight [11%]), and back pain (17 [24%] vs 13 [18%]). 38 (54%) of 71 patients in the olaparib and abiraterone group and 20 (28%) of 71 patients in the placebo and abiraterone group had grade 3 or worse adverse events, including anaemia (in 15 [21%] of 71 patients vs none of 71), pneumonia (four [6%] vs three [4%]), and myocardial infarction (four [6%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported by 24 (34%) of 71 patients receiving olaparib and abiraterone (seven of which were related to treatment) and 13 (18%) of 71 patients receiving placebo and abiraterone (one of which was related to treatment). One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the olaparib and abiraterone group.

INTERPRETATION: Olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone. More serious adverse events were observed in patients who received olaparib and abiraterone than abiraterone alone. Our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

We randomized 202 patients with treatment-naïve mCRPC to abiraterone or enzalutamide and performed whole-exome and deep targeted 72-gene sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA prior to therapy. For these agents, which have never been directly compared, time to progression was similar. Defects in<i>BRCA2</i>and<i>ATM</i>were strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of clinical prognostic factors and circulating tumor DNA abundance. Somatic alterations in<i>TP53</i>, previously linked to reduced tumor dependency on AR signaling, were also independently associated with rapid resistance. Although detection of<i>AR</i>amplifications did not outperform standard prognostic biomarkers,<i>AR</i>gene structural rearrangements truncating the ligand binding domain were identified in several patients with primary resistance. These findings establish genomic drivers of resistance to first-line AR-directed therapy in mCRPC and identify potential minimally invasive biomarkers.<b>Significance:</b>Leveraging plasma specimens collected in a large randomized phase II trial, we report the relative impact of common circulating tumor DNA alterations on patient response to the most widely used therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies.

RESULTS: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in<i>BRCA1</i>,<i>BRCA2</i>, or<i>ATM</i>; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review.

RESULTS: In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib.

CONCLUSIONS: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

A published report showed that men with prostate cancer who were resistant to the second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide had increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on circulating antigen-presenting cells. We hypothesized that the addition of PD-1 inhibition in these patients could induce a meaningful cancer response.

METHODS: We evaluated enzalutamide plus the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a single-arm phase II study of 28 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mprogressing on enzalutamide alone. Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous was given every 3 weeks for four doses with enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50%. Secondary endpoints were objective response, PSA progression-free survival (PFS), time to subsequent treatment, and time to death. Baseline tumor biopsies were obtained when feasible, and samples were sequenced and evaluated for the expression of PD-L1, microsatellite instability (MSI), mutational and neoepitope burdens.

RESULTS: Five (18%) of 28 patients had a PSA decline of ≥50%. Three (25%) of 12 patients with measurable disease at baseline achieved an objective response. Of the five responders, two continue with PSA and radiographic response after 39.3 and 37.8 months. For the entire cohort, median follow-up was 37 months, and median PSA PFS time was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 9.9 months). Time to subsequent treatment was 7.21 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 11.1 months). Median overall survival for all patients was 21.9 months (95% CI: 14.7 to 28 .4 months), versus 41.7 months (95% CI: 22.16 to not reached (NR)) in the responders. Of the three responders with baseline biopsies, one had MSI high disease with mutations consistent with DNA-repair defects. None had detectable PD-L1 expression.

CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab has activity in mCRPC when added to enzalutamide. Responses were deep and durable and did not require tumor PD-L1 expression or DNA-repair defects.

Key endpoints were investigator-assessed radiographic response per modified RECIST/PCWG3 and PSA response (≥50% decrease from baseline).

RESULTS: TRITON2 enrolled 78 patients with a non-<i>BRCA</i>DDR gene alteration [<i>ATM</i>(<i>n</i>= 49),<i>CDK12</i>(<i>n</i>= 15),<i>CHEK2</i>(<i>n</i>= 12), and other DDR genes (<i>n</i>= 14)]. Among patients evaluable for each endpoint, radiographic and PSA responses were observed in a limited number of patients with an alteration in<i>ATM</i>[2/19 (10.5%) and 2/49 (4.1%), respectively],<i>CDK12</i>[0/10 (0%) and 1/15 (6.7%), respectively], or<i>CHEK2</i>[1/9 (11.1%) and 2/12 (16.7%), respectively], including no radiographic or PSA responses in 11 patients with confirmed biallelic<i>ATM</i>loss or 11 patients with<i>ATM</i>germline mutations. Responses were observed in patients with alterations in the DDR genes<i>PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1</i>, and<i>RAD51B</i>.

CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, genomics-driven study of rucaparib in mCRPC, we found limited radiographic/PSA responses to PARP inhibition in men with alterations in<i>ATM, CDK12</i>, or<i>CHEK2</i>. However, patients with alterations in other DDR-associated genes (e.g.,<i>PALB2</i>) may benefit from PARP inhibition.<i>See related commentary by Sokolova et al., p. 2439</i>.",0.029

TALAPRO-1 is an open-label study evaluating TALA (a potent PARP inhibitor/trapper) in men with mCRPC/DDRm. We report a planned interim analysis (IA; Dec 2019). Updated results at a Sep 4 2020 cut-off, available in November 2020, will be presented at the meeting. Methods: TALAPRO-1 (NCT03148795) is enrolling pts (N ≈ 100) with measurable soft tissue disease, progressive mCRPC, and DDRm likely to sensitize to PARPi ( ATM, ATR, BRCA1/2, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C), who received 1–2 chemotherapy regimens (≥1 taxane-based) for metastatic disease and progressed on ≥1 NHT (enzalutamide/abiraterone acetate) given for mCRPC. DDRm are defined as known/likely pathogenic variants or homozygous deletions. Pts receive oral TALA 1 mg/day (moderate renal impairment 0.75 mg/day) until radiographic progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death. Primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints: time to objective response; response duration; prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decrease ≥50%; circulating tumor cell (CTC) count conversion (to CTC = 0 and <5 per 7.5 mL blood); time to PSA progression; radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS); overall survival; safety. A planned efficacy/safety IA was done when 60 pts with DDRm and measurable disease completed ≥6 months of TALA/no longer followed. Radiographic responses are based on investigator assessments. Results: 113 pts received TALA (cut-off Dec 12 2019); 75 pts were evaluable for IA, with DDRm, had measurable disease, received ≥16 weeks’ treatment, and were assessed for ORR (54.7% BRCA1/2, 4.0% PALB2, 22.7% ATM; 18.7% other DDRm).All pts evaluable for IA had prior docetaxel; 45.3% cabazitaxel. Confirmed ORR, rPFS, and composite response (investigator-assessed) in pts who received TALA for ≥16 weeks are in the table. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events: anemia (42.5%); nausea (32.7%). Conclusions: TALA monotherapy has encouraging antitumor activity in docetaxel-pretreated mCRPC pts with BRCA1/2 alterations and was generally well tolerated. Funding: Pfizer Inc.

We present results from patients with mCRPC associated with a<i>BRCA</i>alteration treated with rucaparib 600 mg twice daily in the phase II TRITON2 study.

METHODS: We enrolled patients who progressed after one to two lines of next-generation androgen receptor-directed therapy and one taxane-based chemotherapy for mCRPC. Efficacy and safety populations included patients with a deleterious<i>BRCA</i>alteration who received ≥ 1 dose of rucaparib. Key efficacy end points were objective response rate (ORR; per RECIST/Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 in patients with measurable disease as assessed by blinded, independent radiology review and by investigators) and locally assessed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥ 50% decrease from baseline) rate.

RESULTS: Efficacy and safety populations included 115 patients with a<i>BRCA</i>alteration with or without measurable disease. Confirmed ORRs per independent radiology review and investigator assessment were 43.5% (95% CI, 31.0% to 56.7%; 27 of 62 patients) and 50.8% (95% CI, 38.1% to 63.4%; 33 of 65 patients), respectively. The confirmed PSA response rate was 54.8% (95% CI, 45.2% to 64.1%; 63 of 115 patients). ORRs were similar for patients with a germline or somatic<i>BRCA</i>alteration and for patients with a<i>BRCA1</i>or<i>BRCA2</i>alteration, while a higher PSA response rate was observed in patients with a<i>BRCA2</i>alteration. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse event was anemia (25.2%; 29 of 115 patients).

CONCLUSION: Rucaparib has antitumor activity in patients with mCRPC and a deleterious<i>BRCA</i>alteration, but with a manageable safety profile consistent with that reported in other solid tumor types.",0.120

Niraparib is a once daily highly selective inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1 and 2). Methods: GALAHAD is an ongoing open label Ph 2 study assessing niraparib (300 mg daily) in pts with DRD progressing on/after ARSIs and taxane chemotherapy. Using a validated plasma assay, DRD status was defined as pathogenic mutations (including homozygous deletions) of BRCA1/2, ATM, FANCA, PALB2, CHEK2, BRIP1 or HDAC2. Composite response rate (RR) was defined as an objective response by RECIST 1.1 for measurable disease, circulating tumor cell (CTC) conversion to < 5/7.5 mL blood or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% (PSA50). Here, preliminary data on RR and adverse events (AEs) are reported in pts with biallelic DRD. Results: As of 10 Sep 2018, 123 pts with mCRPC and DRD were enrolled, of whom 39 had biallelic DRD (23 BRCA1/2). The median follow-up was 5.7 mo (2.0–23.7). Table depicts RRs for pts with biallelic DRD by BRCA status. Composite and objective RRs were 65% and 38% in pts with biallelic BRCA1/2, respectively. 3/8 pts (38% [2/5 BRCA1/2 and 1/3 non-BRCA]) with measurable visceral metastases showed objective response. Among the 20 biallelic responders, the duration of treatment (tx) has exceeded 4 mo in 13 pts and 6 mo in 8 pts; 14 pts remain on tx. The most common grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were anemia (25%) and thrombocytopenia (15%) (manageable by dose reduction/interruption). The most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic AEs were asthenia (6%) and hypertension (5%). Conclusions: These results suggest niraparib has compelling activity as monotherapy for pts with treatment-resistant mCRPC, particularly those with biallelic BRCA1/2 identified by a blood assay.
