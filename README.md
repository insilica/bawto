# Biomarkers Associated With Therapeutic Outcomes (BAWTO) In Prostate Cancer
This provides scripts and gists for creating/analyzing data synthesized from prostate cancer publication data. 

Three sysrev projects were created for this analysis:

  1. [sysrev.com/p/63101](https://sysrev.com/u/139/p/63101): screening project for clinicaltrials.gov metadata
  2. [sysrev.com/p/68027](https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/68027): screening project for pubmed abstracts 
  3. [sysrev.com/p/70431](https://sysrev.com/p/70431): pubmed data extraction project

# Directory structure

**1. ct.gov meoto trial screening**  
Finds/Uploads ct.gov trials to screen in sysrev.com/p/63101

**2. analyze ct.gov meoto sysrev**  
Analyze the ct.gov data for trials screened in (1)


# Roadmap
1. Transform figure code into gists
2. push gists
3. create tests confirming that gists work
4. (optional) upload code used to set up reviews.
