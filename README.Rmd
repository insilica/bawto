Scripts and gists for creating/analyzing data synthesized from prostate cancer clinical trial publications.

Three sysrev projects were created for this analysis:

  1. [sysrev.com/p/63101](https://sysrev.com/u/139/p/63101): screening project for clinicaltrials.gov metadata
  2. [sysrev.com/p/68027](https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/68027): screening project for pubmed abstracts 
  3. [sysrev.com/p/70431](https://sysrev.com/p/70431): pubmed data extraction project
